## Nouns

Nouns are words representing objects, materials, persons or places.  

**examples:**

* bana    = banana
* akwa    = water
* plumb   = lead
* feron   = iron


**rules:**

* Regular nouns are ending with letters {`a`,`e`};
* Most nouns have 2 syllables, quite rare 3 syllables;

**examples:**

Regular nouns are using different coda for singular and plural:

* pana   = bread  (singular)
* pane   = breads (plural)

**gender**

In Maj, nouns do not have a specific coda for genre but use adjectives instead.

* maqo Kania = male dog 
* fimo Kania = female dog 

**implicit gender**

Some words include gender and do not require adjectives but some nouns do not have gender at all:

* Kida = child    
* Kide = children 
* Cika = girl 
* Nina = boy
* Pare = parents 
* Mama = mother
* Papa = father
* Khpitan = captain

## Invariant nouns

There are some nouns that you can not count. These nouns have volume and mass but do not represent individual objects. These nouns end with a consonant.

* Some materials that can have weight but you can not count
* Loquids that you can measure volume for but you can not count
* Gases that you can measure volume for but you can not count

## Proper nouns

Proper noun use uppercase to represent names. 

* CHICAGO   = The city of Chicago
* SANA      = Santa Claus

Things, titles and events start with uppercase.

* Crimys    = Christmas 
* Maj       = Language Maj
* Khpitan   = Captain
* Abora     = Tree      
* Qerda     = Pig

## Prefix preposition

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant as prefix to create a new meaning for words:

* kan  = not  - create antonyms
* nam  = for  - specify purpose / person
* ati  = anti - against / opposite 
* eko  = acho - environment friendly / organic

**examples:**

* nam-bebo = for drink
* kan-bebo = not for drink
* ati-gera = anti war
* eko-vaja = echo travel
   
## Noun suffixes

* You can add a suffix to a noun to add information about the noun properties.
* After root you can use apostrophe `'` to connect with a suffix.

You can use suffix to create a composite word for representing nouns:

## Diminutives (small)

Maj enable diminutives (likable) using suffix i'na

ni = nito = nice

**close persons**

* xero Mami'na  = "dear mother"
* xero Papi'na  = "dear father"

**animals (pets)**

* Katia = cat
* Kania = dog

* nito Kari'na => nice kitty
* nito Kani'na => nice doggy

**note:** Proper nouns (names of places or persons) do not support diminutives.

## Superlative (large)

For substantive larger then usual, you can use ending: "o'ga"

* gaso = large
* ingo = huge

**examples:**

* eta ingo Kato'ga => this large kitten
* eta gaso Kano'ga => this large dog

## Group words

For a scientific group of words we use plural + suffix "e'xa"

* xatu = to know

**examples:**

* la pole'xa = the science of plants
* la fuje'xa = the science of fruits
* la veje'xa = the science of vegetables
* la veve'xa = the science of leaving beans

## First nouns
