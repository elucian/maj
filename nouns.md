# Nouns

A noun is a word used to identify something. There are two kind of nouns:

* _common noun_ for: category of people, places, or things;
* _proper noun_ for: specific name for people, places or things;

**rules**

* Nouns are usually terminated with vowel {"a" or "e"};
* Nouns are usually from 2 up to 3 syllables long;
* Nouns representing persons are starting with uppercase letter;
* Names are written with all CAPITAL LETTERS;

**examples:**

* CHICAGO   = The city of Chicago
* SANA      = Santa Claus
* Crimys    = Christmas 
* MAJ       = Language MAJ
* Majisan   = A person who know MAJ

2. for distinguish between male and female beings we use adjectives: 

* maso  = male    (latin: masculum)
* femo  = female  (latin: feminam)

```
maso cyne  = dog male
femo cyne  = dog female
```

## Noun suffix

* In Maj a word have a root. To this root you can add a suffix.
* After root you can use apostrophe `'` to connect with a suffix.

Sometimes we use suffix to create a composite word for representing nouns:

**harmful content**

* for beverage containing alcohol, we use suffix 'ola 
* there is food prepared with alcohol we also use 'ola 
* for food that contains a lot of sugar we use 'osa,  

```
* ber'ola  = bear
* gas'osa  = sweet drink
* xoc'osa  = sweet chocolate
* xoc'ola  = sweet chocolate with alcohol
```

**diminutives**

Maj enable diminutives using suffix: 'uca. 

```
** close persons
Mam'uca  = mommy
Tat'uca  = daddy

** close pet
maso cyn'uca  = dogy male
femo cyn'uca  = dogy female
```

**notes**
* Whe a noun is uses suffix, it looses a vowel from last syllable that is replaced by apostrophe,
* Proper nouns (names of places or persons) do not support diminutives.

## Noun prefix

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant to create a new meaning for words:

* non  = not - create antonyms
* por  = for - specify purpose

```
por'bebo aqua = drinking water
non'bebo aqua = industrial water
non'bola beba = non alcoholic drink
```
