## Nouns

Nouns are words representing objects, materials, persons or places.  

**examples:**

* bana    = banana
* akwa    = water
* plumb   = lead
* feron   = iron


**rules:**

* Regular nouns are ending with letters {`a`,`e`};
* Nouns that end in a consonant are invariant nouns;
* Most nouns have 2 syllables, quite rare 3 syllables;
* Nouns that represent leaving beens start with uppercase;

Examples:

* Kide   = children    
* Pare   = parents 
* Kania  = dog

**plural:**

Regular nouns are using different ending for singular and plural:

* pana   = bread  (singular)
* pane   = breads (plural)

**gender:**

In Maj, nouns do not have a specific ending for genre but use adjectives instead.

* maqo Kania = male dog 
* fimo Kania = female dog 

Note: in this case, since the adjective is the defining nature of the noun it is placed before the noun. In general the adjective is placed after the noun:

* la Kania es niso = this dog is nice
* la Kania es nito = this dog is clean

**implicit gender**

Some words include gender and do not require adjective.

* Cika = girl 
* Nina = boy
* Mama = mother
* Papa = father

## Invariant nouns

Some nouns are representing materials or substances not individual objects. In this case the nouns end with a consonant. For these there is not plural available:

* Materials
* Liquids
* Gases
* Chemicals
* Processes

**examples:**

* karbon = charbon
* klorin = chlor
* kodes  = condensation
* 


## Proper nouns

Proper noun use uppercase to represent names. 

* CHICAGO   = The city of Chicago
* SANA      = Santa Claus

Things, titles and events start with uppercase.

* Navida    = Christmas 
* Maj       = Language Maj
* Kapta     = Captain
* Abora     = Tree      
* Qerda     = Pig

**note:* The word Kapth represents an occupation. Sometimes the occupation becomes the occupation and is considered proper noun. So it can be written with uppercase or lowercase. Ocupation names also can terminate in "h". 

* tu es la Kapta = you are the captain
* io doru bo kapth = I wish to be captain

## Prefix particles

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant as prefix to create a new meaning for words:

* kan  = not  - create antonyms
* nam  = for  - specify purpose / person
* ati  = anti - against / opposite 
* eko  = acho - environment friendly / organic

**examples:**

* nam-bebo = for drink
* kan-bebo = not for drink
* ati-gera = anti war
* eko-vaja = echo travel
   
## Noun suffixes

* You can add a suffix to a noun to add information about the noun properties.
* After root you can use apostrophe `'` to connect with a suffix.

You can use suffix to create a composite word for representing nouns:

## Diminutives (small)

Maj enable diminutives (likable) using suffix i'na

ni = nito = nice

**close persons**

* xero Mami'na  = "dear mother"
* xero Papi'na  = "dear father"

**animals (pets)**

* Katia = cat
* Kania = dog

* nito Kari'na => nice kitty
* nito Kani'na => nice doggy

**note:** Proper nouns (names of places or persons) do not support diminutives.

## Superlative (large)

For substantive larger then usual, you can use ending: "o'ga"

* gaso = large
* ingo = huge

**examples:**

* eta ingo Kato'ga => this large kitten
* eta gaso Kano'ga => this large dog

## Group words

For a scientific group of words we use plural + suffix "e'xa"

* xatu = to know

**examples:**

* la pole'xa = the science of plants
* la fuje'xa = the science of fruits
* la veje'xa = the science of vegetables
* la veve'xa = the science of leaving beans

## First nouns

First nouns examples represent close persons:
