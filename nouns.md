## Nouns

Nouns are words representing objects, persons or places.  Nouns have a root form that is invariant and a coda that can change. Most nouns are ending with `a` that can change into `e`. When a noun is ending with `e` it represents plural.  

**examples:**

* pana   = bread
* pane   = breads
* bana   = banana
* bane   = bananas
* aqua   = water
* huga   = juice  

**gender**

For distinguish between male and female beings we use adjectives: 

* maso  = male    (latin: masculum)
* femo  = female  (latin: feminam)

```
maso cana = dog male
femo cana = dog female
```

## Noun suffix

* You can add a suffix to a noun to add information about the noun properties.
* After root you can use apostrophe `'` to connect with a suffix.

Sometimes we use suffix to create a composite word for representing nouns:

**harmful content**

* for beverage containing alcohol, we use suffix 'ola 
* there is food prepared with alcohol we also use 'ola 
* for food that contains a lot of sugar we use 'osa,  

```
* ber'ola  = bear
* gas'osa  = sweet drink
* xoc'osa  = sweet chocolate
* xoc'ola  = sweet chocolate with alcohol
```

**diminutives**

Maj enable diminutives using suffix: 'uca. 


** close persons
* Mam'uca  = mommy
* Tat'uca  = daddy

** close pet
* maso can'uca  = dogy male
* femo can'uca  = dogy female


**notes**
* Whe a noun is uses suffix, it looses a vowel from last syllable that is replaced by apostrophe,
* Proper nouns (names of places or persons) do not support diminutives.
