# Alphabet

Rules of alphabet:

* Vowels are stand alone sounds: A E I O U
* Constants have a special pronunciation not available in alphabet:
* There are 45 letters in Maj alphabet.

```
------------------------------------------
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   L
a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   l
------------------------------------------
M   N   O   P   R   S   T   U   V   Y   Z
m   n   o   p   r   s   t   u   v   y   z
------------------------------------------
```

**Pronunciation**

Under each letter I have used [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)

------------------------------------------
a   b    c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   l
a   b    c   d   e   f   g   h   j   ʒ   l
------------------------------------------
m   n   o   p   r   s   t   u   v   y   z
m   n   o   p   r   s   t   u   v   y   z
------------------------------------------

**notes**

Reading the alphabet is different from other Romantic Languages:

* After each consonant you add a short "ɨ" sound like "eo" from "pitgeon",
* The above rule is active only when the consonant is standing alone

* Sound `a`  is open, like `a` in "car",
* Sound `i`  is not "ai" but similar to "ee" in "sheep",
* Sound `e`  is open, similar to "e"  in "melon",
* Sound `y`  is like "ei", same like "y" in "play", "yes",
* Sound `j`  is trilled, similar to sound "si" in "fusion".
* Sound `s`  is like "s" in "snake" but is changing if is follow by `h`
* Sound `z`  is trilled similar to `z` in "zoo".
* Sound `r`  is trilled similar to "rr" in "Africa"
* Sound `v`  is trilled like "v" in "vehicle"
* Sound `p`  is like `p` in "piton" but is changing if is follow by `h`
* Sound `c`  is like `k` but is changing if is follow by `h`

**Trilled R**

R is the most difficult letter of the Maj language. It is stronger than English R, more like double "rr" but has a shorter pronunciation. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Trilled J**

Letter "J", "j" is trilled. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must try to produce "h" and a fricative "s" with the middle of your tongue touching the mouth roof. The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ".

Sounds "je,ji", "Je,Ji" are even more difficult, it is pronounced "dʒ" like in "giraf", "gin". Observe that "gi" and "ge" are more natural to read like in English "guitar", "get". 


* Digraphs

This sounds are created using two letters that produce a different sound.

maj| romanian  | phonetic(*)  |
---|-----------|--------------|
ts | ţe,  ţi   | t͡s          |
sh | şe,  şi   | ʂ            |
ch | ce,  ci   | t͡ɕ          |
ce | che       |              |
ci | chi       |              |
ge | ghe, ghi  | ɢe, ɢi       |
ja | ja,  ju   | ʒa, ʒa       |
je | ge,  gi   | dʒ           |

**notes:**

* sound "ja"  is pronounced "ʒa", almost like "sha" but trilled,
* sound "je"  is like "ge" in "generator",
* sound "ji"  is like "gi" in "gin",
* sound "ge"  is like "g" in  "get", "gear", "gees",
* sound "gi"  is like "g" in  "guitar",
* sound "sh"  is like "sh" in "she" or "ti" in "addiction" or "ss" in "passion"
* sound "ch"  is like "ch" in "cheese", "peach"
* sound "ts"  and "tz" are similar to "z" in German "zuruck = back"
* sound "ue"  and "ui" are similar to "we", "wi" in "wet", "whisky"

## Not used

Maj do not use consonants with cedilla that are specific to other Romantic Languages:

* { X K W Q } 
* { î ă â ö ü é è ç ş ţ ...}

**Notes**

* Maj accept names from other Romantic languages without phonetic translation:  
* For example New York, Chicago or Washington are acceptable names in Maj.
* For example France is accepted but "française" should be translated to "franchez"

**X** 
* instead of X we use /cs/. For example "sex" is written "secs".

**K** 
* can be replaced by /c/. The only exception is in "ch".

**W**
* instead of W we use  "U" and "V" so it is replaced by "U" for example: Wisky is written Uiscy

**Q** 
Is not found in other modern alphabets:

* Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, 
* Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
* Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, 
* Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh. 

## Vowels

Maj has 5 vowels and 2 semivowels

* Vowels     : { a e i o u } 
* Semivowels : { y j l }

## Consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 4 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, c, p, t, g
* nasal   :  m, n
* liquid  :  l, r
* fricative: f, v, s, z, h

**combination:** 

Some CC combinations can produce a different sound (digraphs):

* "ts" is a single sound: ţ 
* "ch" is a single sound: ş 
* "cu" is a single sound: q 

Other two consonants can be pronounced together but some restrictions apply:

* is not allowed to have two plosive constants together
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz dl 
dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nl nm np ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lm ln lp ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv

## Diphthong

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

Open vowels: { a  e  i o  u }
Semi vowels: { j  y  l} 


**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u   | j | y |
--|---|---|---|---|----|---|---|
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au  |aj |ay |
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu  |ej |ey |
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu  |ij | · |
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou  |oj |oy |
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·  |uj |uy |
j |ja |je |ji |jo |ju  | · |jy |
l |la |le |li |lo |lu  | . |ly
y |Ya |Ye | . |Yo |Yu  |Yj | · |

**notes**

* One letter is never duplicated in Maj,
* Combinations that can not be pronounced are banned,
* First letter in diphthong can not be "y" but "Y",
* Diphtong starting with open vowels are called "strong"

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals. 
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong, S = Semivowels
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|"
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts

```python
# syllable structure
syllable ::= onset   + rhyme
onset    ::= initial +(medial)
rime     ::= nucleus +(coda)

# onset components
initial  ::= C| V | SV
medial   ::= {h s e i } is used in digraphs

# rime is the last part
nucleus + coda
nucleus  ::= V|VV|VS
coda     ::= C|CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable ...:

* can start with vowel or consonant
* can not start with a strong diphthong
* can have a nucleus formed from one or two vowels
* can have a coda formed with one or two consonants
 
## Word connectivity

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vocals can be used at beginning of words: { y j l }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words,
4. Composite words using two words must be separated by dash: "bon-acta"

# Complexity

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Const for complexity of a word. So less expensive words can be learned faster. Gradualy we can introduce more more complex words for advanced speakers.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|-------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u        
  2    |m, n, l, y 
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, g
  4    |f, s, h,
  5    |v, j, s, r  
  6    |ts, sh, ch, gu

**calculation**  
Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce total cost of the language. The better the cost, the better the language is and more easy to understand. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages not only for Maj.
