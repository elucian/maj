# Alphabet

Maj is using: [ISO Basic Latin Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

**uppercase**
```
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M
N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   X   Y   Z   W
```

**lowercase**
```
a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   K   l   m
n   o   p   q   r   s   t   u   v   x   y   z   w
```

**Notes**

There are 26 letters in Maj alphabet.

Reading the alphabet is different from other Romantic Languages:

* In English alphabet you add an open sound "e" after consonants, but in Maj `ɨ`;
* In Maj you add a short `ɨ` sound after consonants like "eo" from "pigeon";
* The above rule is active only when a consonant letter is standing alone;

**Vowels**

The vowels are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Sound  `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in "car";
* Sound  `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in "melon";
* Sound  `i`  is close front, like first `i` in "initial";
* Sound  `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Sound  `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

**Other sounds**

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Sound  `y`  is close central like `io` in "fashion";
* Sound  `j`  is trilled, similar to sound `si` in "fusion";
* Sound  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Sound  `z`  is trilled similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Sound  `r`  is trilled similar to `rr` in "Africa";
* Sound  `v`  is trilled like `v` in "vehicle";
* Sound  `g`  is plosive uvular like `g` in "gees", "guitar", "get";
* Sound  `k`  is fricative `c` like `k` in "sky";
* Sound  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or `sh` in "fashion";
* Sound  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey".

**Notation**

I have try to use: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)
notation to represent special Maj sounds.

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter of the Maj language. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Trilled J**

Letter "J", "j" is always trilled. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must press the tip of your tongue in the roof top and produce a voiced "sh". The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 

**Whistled C**

Letter "C", "c" is whistled when followed by one of {`e`,`i`,`h`}. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce a fricative "ch". The best symbol for this sound is "t͡ʃ"

**Fricative Q**

Letter "Q", "q" is pronounced "ɢ" when followed by {`e`, `i`}. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a fricative voiced "gue" or "gui". The best symbol for this sound is "ɢ".

Letter "Q" follow by "u" is pronounced "k". So the "que" or "qui" is read "ke" and "ki" instead of "gue" and "gui". That is inconvenient bu no writing is perfect so we have this exception.

## Digraphs

Some sounds are created using two letters creating a new sounds. 

maj| romanian | phonetic(*)  
---|----------|--------------
yi | â, î     | ɨ͡i
iy | â, î     | i͡ɨ
ts | ţ        | t͡s
ce | ce       | t͡ʃe
ci | ci       | t͡ʃi
ge | ge       | d͡ʒe
gi | gi       | d͡ʒi
qe | ghe      | ɢe
qi | ghi      | ɢi

   
**description:**

* sound `ts`  is `t͡s` like `t's` in "cats";
* sound `yi`  is `i͡ɨ` like `eo`  in "pigeon";
* sound `ce`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "chase"; 
* sound `ci`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "peach";
* sound `sh`  is `ʃ`   like `sh`  in "fashion";
* sound `ge`  is `d͡ʒ` like `ge`  in "Georgia";
* sound `gi`  is `d͡ʒ` like `gi`  in "Georgia";

## Silent `h`

Sometimes letter `h` is silent, some other times is voiced:

* Letter `h` is always voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is voiced when is following or preceding a vowel;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following a consonant;

**Notes** 

* Letter `h` can be used after `c` to make sound `t͡ʃ` like in word: `pitch`.
* Letter `h` can be used after `s` to make sound `ʃ` like in word: `she`.

In Romanian, `h` is used to prevent digraph formation in groups "che", "chi", "ghe", "ghi", this convention can not be used in Maj since it enters in conflict with English convention which is more popular. However Maj has 2 digraphs not available in English:

For Romanians:

* sound `qe` = sound `ghe`
* sound `gi` = sound `ghi`
* sound `ke` = sound `che`
* sound `ki` = sound `chi`

## Cedilla

Though elegant and useful in other Languages, Maj do not use cedilla:

* { î â ă ö ü é è ç ş ţ ...}

**notes**

* Most names from other Romanic languages do not need phonetic translation
* New York, Chicago or Washington are read correctly in Maj
* France is accepted but "française" should be translated to "francez"

## Modified Letters

{W, Q, K, X, Y}

**Rarely used: W**
* can be present only at beginning of words: for example: "whiskey".
* inside or at end of words we always use "u" not "w".

**Modified: Q** 

Maj has a special use for Q:

* At beginning of words `Q` is similar pronounced like `qu` in Latin alphabet,
* In the middle of the words is pronounced "ɢ" like "g" in "rogue",
* After `q` you can use {`e`,`i`} to create diphthongs "ge", "gi".

For example: "aqua" is going to be pronounced: "agua"

Note: Q is not present in following alphabets:

* Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, 
* Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
* Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, 
* Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh. 

**Modified: X**
* In Maj, X is pronounced like Chinese: `ʃ` and is replacement for `sh` in long words;
* The romantic X is converted into `cs` when is the case, to avoid `ʃ` pronunciation;

**Modified: Y**
* `y` at the beginning of words is pronounced "Y" like in New York, Yes, Yacht;
* `y` can be pronounced both `ɨ` like `eo` in "pigeon" or `ə` like `a`  in "chocolate";

**Modified: K**
* `k` is used to avoid duplicate letter `c` in words like `akcidy`;
* `k` is used before {`e`,`i`} to prevent formation of diphthongs: {`ke`, `ki`};

## Phonetic examples

If we were to use Maj alphabet we could write some English words like this:

she       => xe
generator => generetyr
pigeon    => pigiyn
giraffe   => giraf
fusion    => fujyn
guitar    => qitar
gees      => qis
cheese    => ciz
accident  => akcidynt 
chocolate => cioclyt
peach     => pici
speech    => spici
initial   => inixyl  
fashion   => faxyn
yacht     => yaht

## Consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 4 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated in maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz 
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft fj
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

## Vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 


## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals,
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong,
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```python

# syllable structure
rime     ::= initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  ::=  C 
nucleus  ::=  V | VV | CV
coda     ::=  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of words
* start with one consonant otherwise
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels 
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants
* not all syllables have coda

A syllable can not ...;

* contain `h` after a consonant,
* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word composition

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vowels can be used at beginning of words: { y w }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words,

# Complexity

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Cost for word complexity. So less expensive words can be learned faster. Gradualy one can assimilate more more complex words.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u
  2    |l, m, n, h, y 
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, f, s, q 
  4    |v, j, g, k, x, z, r, w 

**calculation**  
Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce total cost of the language. The better the cost, the better the language is and more easy to understand. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages not only for Maj.
