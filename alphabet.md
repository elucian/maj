**Reading:**

Before you can read the Maj alphabet, you must learn the pronounce of each letter.

**Notes:**

* Maj has voiced, articulated and clear sounds easy to produce;
* Maj sounds are produced with your tongue behind your teeth;
* You will never bite yourself or spit around when you speak Maj;

## Phonetic alphabet

We use phonetic symbols from: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 

**Notes:** 

* Maj foreign words and phonetic are enclosed with double quotes like:"fonetic".
* Most names from other Romanic languages do not need phonetic translation;
* New York, Chicago or Washington are read correctly in Maj phonetic;

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian. Romanian and Spanish not English or German;

* Letter `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like first `i` in `initial`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

**Notes: **
* Tone of the language is not significant in Maj;
* Maj is a written language and there is no aid for accent;
* All vowels are read, even the last vowel called coda is read;

## Semi vowels

_Letter `Y`:_ is pronounced different depending on its position.

1. Initial position: "y" = `i` at the beginning of words like: York, Yes, Yacht;  
2. First   position: "ŷ" = `ɨ` in the middle of words like "eo" in "pigeon";
3. Second  position: "ў" = `ə` is used at end of words  like "ar" in "sugar";
   
**Notes: **

* Maj is using "y" or "Y" at beginning of words never "i" or "I";
* Maj letters "ŷ", "ў" can be present in elevated writings (story books);

_Letter `W`:_  is called soft `u`, is mostly used at beginning of words words. It is pronounced "u" like "w" in "whiskey". It creates diphthongs: {"wa","we", "wi", "wo", "wu","wy"}. The vowel is much longer than usual, forming words like: 

* wa: "uaa" (administration)
* wo: "uoo" (surprise)
* wy: "uəə" (disgusting)
* wi: "uee" (happiness)
* we: "wee" (sadness)
* wu: "uuu" (disapproval)

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `c`  is fricative, alveolar, like `ts` in "cats" or `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `h`  is fricative, glottal like "h" in "hoard"
* Letter  `j`  is palatal vibrated, similar to sound `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `q`  is alveoli-palatal like "ch" in words like "charm", "church", "chin";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `z`  is dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";

## Digraphs

Specific groups of two letters can be pronounced different than both letters. Maj digraphs are redundant. That means the combination of these two letters can be replaced by another letter. This makes Maj words shorter than English words.

* group `ts` = `c` sounds `t͡s` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* group `ch` = `q` sounds `t͡ʃ` like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolo-palatal_affricate)
* group `sh` = `x` sounds `ʂ`   like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolo-palatal_fricative)

**examples:** 

* "qoka"  is read IPA:"t͡ʃoka"  and it means Eng: "chocolate";
* "koqa"  is read IPA:"kot͡ʃa"  and it means Eng: "coach";
* "qica"  is read IPA:"t͡ʃika"  and it means Eng: "girl";
* "xava"  is read IPA:"ʂava"    and it means Eng: "shovel";
* "cita"  is read IPA:"t͡sita"  and it means Eng: "target";

**notes:**

1. English is inconsistent when is about digraphs. Sometimes "ch" is read "k", other times `ʂ` or `k`. Therefore in English you must learn how to "spell" correctly. Maj can be rad and write "by ear".

* chemical  = IPA:"kemicəl"
* chocolate = IPA:"ʂoklət"

2. In English sounds "ce", "ci" is pronounced "se", "si", but in Maj, "c" is pronounced "t͡s". Therefore if we read next two English using Maj rules you have a similar pronunciation: 

* cerebellum = IPA: "t͡serəbelum"
* cigarette  = IPA: "t͡sigəret"

In Maj the groups {ca, ce, ci, co, cu} are also read {t͡sa, t͡se, t͡si, t͡so, t͡su}. To prevent this effect you must use letter "k" instead of "c". Uppercase "C" also represent "carbon" chemical element that is written "carba" = IPA:"t͡sarba" no need to write "karba" this could be confusing since "K" = "kaola" si for potassium.

## Difficult sounds

**Palatal: ñ* 

Letter "ñ" is inherited from Spanish. It can be used in elevated text but usually in chat it is not used, nor necessary. This sound can be produced when "n" is not the first letter of the word but the second. Also it must be followed by a vowel. IPA symbol for "ñ" is: "ɲ". 

* niña = IPA: "niɲa"  = child
* niñe = IPA: "niɲos" = children
* pañe = IPA: "paɲe"  = breads (plural)

**Alveolar: n*

Letter "N" or "n" at beginning of words is nasal-alveolar. To make this sound press the tip of the tongue on the rooftop of your mouth and voice using a vowel for example "no" like Eng: "north".


**Trilled R**

Letter "R" and "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 

Letter "R" do not control pronunciation of neighbor vowels. So "ar" is not pronounced "ər" like in English. To make "ər" sound you must use "ўr" but is not used in casual chat. 

**Vibrate J**

Letter "J", "j" is labial vibrated before any vowel. That means your tongue tip will vibrate softly. To make this sound your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times similar to "sh" but vibrated. The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 

* "jela" = "jell" is pronounced "ʒela" or "d͡ʒela", it is the same thing.
* "jaza" = "jaz"  is pronounced "ʒaza" or "d͡ʒaza", it is the same thing.

**Plosive G**

Letter "G", "g" is plosive uvular. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof of your mouth and produce a plosive sound like "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ", also known as "Hard G"

**Modified: Q**

Latin Q in Latin and Spanish must be followed by vowel `u`. Maj reuse free "Q" for making a very useful sound: "t͡ʃ" like "ch" in "chin". This eliminate the need to use digraph "ch" in quick conversations. However when "q" is followed by "u" tha reading rule fall back, to allow correct pronounciation of original "Q":

* Maj word "Quin" = "Queen" is read in Maj:"kwin";
* Maj word "aqua" = "water" is read in Maj:"akwa";
* Maj word "qoka" = "chocolate" is read in Maj:"choka";

**Modified: X**

Letters `X` and `x` are pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. To avoid `ş` you can use group `cs`.  To make "ş"  sound you must softly press the middle of your tongue on the roof top of the mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. 

* Word: "sh" means "keep it quiet" similar to many languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʂue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written "Lucsemburg" in Maj to avoid "ʂ";

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.

**Modified: K**

Letter "k" is used to avoid double "c". Therefore "cc" is written "kc". This letter is similar to "g" (plosive-valear) but  is not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in Eng: "culture" or "k" in Eng:"karate". 

Some Maj words starting with "k":

* ka = "not?"  
* ke = "what?" 
* ki = "who?"  

Special uses of "K" in science:

* Kg = Kilogram (metric unit);
* K  = Potassium element;

##Voiced `h`

Letter "h" is usually voiced but sometimes it is silent.

* Letter `h` is voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following a consonant;
* Letter `h` is used after {`c`, `s`, `t`} to make digraphs.

## Maj phonetic

We could write English words using Maj phonetic equivalent like this:

* its       :"iths"
* she       :"xi"
* generator :"djeneretyr"
* pigeon    :"pidjyn"
* giraffe   :"djiraf"
* fusion    :"fudjyn"
* guitar    :"gitar"
* geese     :"gis"
* cheese    :"chiz"
* accident  :"acsidy" 
* chocolate :"choclyt"
* peach     :"pich"
* speech    :"spich"
* initial   :"ynixyl"
* fashion   :"faxyn"
* yacht     :"yot"


## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 5 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated like "cc" in Maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used in words,

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs bj
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz cx
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

Combination of 2 consonants is expensive. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie |ii |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 
y | . | . |yi | . |yu| .  

Combination of 2 vowels is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "1".

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis () optionals,
* V = Vowel, C = Constant
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* We use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```
rime     =  initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  =  V | C 
nucleus  =  V | VV | CV
coda     =  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of word;
* start with one consonant otherwise;
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels;
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants;
* not all syllables have coda;

A syllable can not ...;

* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Syllable that have "coda" are used only for end of words;
3. Two words that have more then one syllable must sound different;

**Patterns:**

* Two letter words {`CV`, `VV`, `VC`, ~`CC`~}
* Three letter words {`VCV`, `VVC`, `VCC`, `CVV`, `CVC`}
* Four letter words starting with vowel: {`~VCVC~`, `VVCV`,`VCCV`,`VCVV`}
* Four letter words starting with consonant: {`CVCV`,`CCVV`,~`CVCC`~,~`CVVC`~}

**Weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to give a _cost_ for word complexity. Less expensive words can be learned faster and should be more frequent. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words that are rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u, y
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, h
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, g  
  4    |v, j, r, z, q, x
  5    |k, w

**Cost:**  

Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce cost. The lower the cost, the better the language is. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages, to compare language complexity. So far after a quick computation of 500 samples Maj is about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

**Word divergence:**

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then the words are sound alike. The sound alike words must represent the same thing. 

For noun "a"/"y"/"e", verb "u", adjective, adverb:"o" are sound alike. Therefore words must be distinguished with another letter to represent different words if they use sound-alike coda vowel. 

For words terminated in sound alike consonants: consonant, the words must differ with another letter in the middle, otherwise they will represent the same word. This rule can have exceptions but preferable not to.

The sound alike function is not yet created.

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
