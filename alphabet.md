# Alphabet

Maj is using: [ISO Basic Latin Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

**uppercase**
```
-------------------------------------------------
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M
N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   X   Y   Z   W
-------------------------------------------------
```

**lowercase**
```

a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   K   l   m
n   o   p   q   r   s   t   u   v   x   y   z   w
--------------------------------------------------
```

**Notes**

There are 26 letters in Maj alphabet.

## Pronunciation

Reading the alphabet is different from other Romantic Languages:

* Vouls are read like in Latin ISO alphabet,
* You can add a short "ɘ" sound after consonants like "eo" from "pitgeon",
* The above rule is active only when a consonant letter is standing alone,
* In English alphabet you add an open sound "e" after consonants, not like in Maj.

**Notation**

Next I will try to use: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)
notation to represent special Maj sounds.

**modified letters**

Most letters sound like ISO latin alphabet from English but some letters are modified to realize a reach pronunciation that is specific to original Latin and Romantinco languages like: Italian, Franch and Romanian.

**With ipa notation**
```
i  y  e  j   c    k  g   x
ɘ  y  e  dʒ  t͡ɕ  c  ɢ   ʃ 
```

**With Romanian notation**

```
i  y  e  j   c   g   k   x 
â  i  e  ge  ce  G   c   ş 
```

* Sound `a`  is open  vowel, like `a` in "car",
* Sound `i`  is middle vowel like "eo" from "pitgeon",
* Sound `y`  is close vowel, like "i" in "play", "yes",
* Sound `e`  is close mid, similar to "e"  in "melon",
* Sound `j`  is trilled, similar to sound "si" in "fusion",
* Sound `c`  is palate-alveolar affricate like "ch" in "peech"
* Sound `s`  is fricative alveolar like "s" in "snake",
* Sound `z`  is trilled similar to `z` in "zoo",
* Sound `r`  is trilled similar to "rr" in "Africa",
* Sound `v`  is trilled like "v" in "vehicle",
* Sound "g"  is post-alveolar affricate like "ge"  in "generator",
* Sound `q`  is plosive uvular like "gu" in `guitar`
* Sound `k`  is fricative "ch" like "k" in "back", "sky",
* Sound `x`  is fricative post-alveolar "sh" in "she".
* Sound `w`  is voiced labial-velar like "w" in "whiskey".

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter of the Maj language. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Trilled J**

Letter "J", "j" is trilled. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must try to produce "h" and a fricative "s" with the middle of your tongue touching the mouth roof. The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ".

* Digraphs

Some sounds are created using two letters that produce a different sound than the two combined letters. 

maj| romanian  | phonetic(*)  
---|-----------|--------------
sh | ş         | ʃ 
ts | ţi        | t͡si         
tz | ţe        | t͡se         
ch | ce, ci    | t͡ɕ  
ca | cea       | t͡ɕ  
ce | cei,      | t͡ɕ  
ci | cia,      | t͡ɕ  
co | cio,      | t͡ɕ  
cu | ciu       | t͡ɕ  

**notes:**

* sound "sh"  is like "s"   in "she" but most of the time is replaced by "x"
* sound "je"  is like "ge"  in "generator",
* sound "ji"  is like "gi"  in "gin",
* sound "g"   is like "g"   in "get", "gear", "gees", "guitar"
* sound "sh"  is like "sh"  in "she" or "ti" in "addiction" or "ss" in "passion"
* sound "ch"  is like "ch"  in "cheese", "peach" or "speech"
* sound "ts"  and "tz" are similar to "z" in German "zuruck = back"
* sound "ue"  and "ui" are similar to "we", "wi" in "wet", "whisky"

## Not used

Maj do not use cedilla found in other Languages:

* { î â ă ö ü é è ç ş ţ ...}

**Notes**

* Maj accept names from other languages without phonetic translation:  
* New York, Chicago or Washington are acceptable names in Maj.
* France is accepted but "française" should be translated to "franchez"

** Rarely used

**W**
* can be present only at beginning of words: for example: "whiskey".
* inside or at end of words we always use "u" follow by "i" or "e".

**Q** 
* is very different from Latin alphabet. I is pronounced "G" like in English "get".
* original "qu" is writthen "ku" in Maj. So "ke" is pronounced "que?" = "what?"

**X**
* In Maj, X is pronounced like in Chinese: "ʃ" and is replacement for "sh".
* The romanic  X is converted into"cs" when we create the words. 


**note:**

Q is not present in following alphabets:

* Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, 
* Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
* Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, 
* Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh. 

## Vowels

Maj has 7 vowels: { a e i o u w y } 

## Consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 4 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, c, p, t, g
* nasal   :  m, n
* liquid  :  l, r
* fricative: f, v, s, z, h

**combination:** 

Some CC combinations can produce a different sound (digraphs):

* "ts" is a single sound: ţ 
* "sh" is a single sound: ş 
* "ch" is a whistled sound like "Ch" in "Chicago"
* "c"  in combination with any vowel create a whistled sound like "ch" in peetch

Other two consonants can be pronounced together but some restrictions apply:

* is not allowed to have two plosive constants together
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz 
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm np nq ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft fj
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
zq 

## Diphthong

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y  
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au|ay  
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu|iy  
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou|oy  
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 
y |ya |ye |yi |yo |yu| .  
w |wa |we |wi |wo |wu|wy 

**notes**

* One letter is never duplicated in Maj,
* W is used only at beginning of words.

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals,
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong,
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,
* V do not include W that is actually a semivowel.

```python
# syllable structure
syllable ::= onset   + rhyme
onset    ::= initial +(medial)
rime     ::= nucleus +(coda)

# onset components
initial  ::= V | W | C
medial   ::= {h s} present in digraphs

# rime is the last part
nucleus + coda
nucleus  ::= V | CV
coda     ::= C | CC
# 
```

**Description:**

A syllable ...:

* can start with vowel or consonant
* can be a single vowel or a diphthong
* can have a nucleus formed from one or two vowels
* can have a coda formed with one or two consonants
 
## Word connectivity

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vocals can be used at beginning of words: { y j l }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words,
4. Composite words using two words must be separated by dash: "bon-acta"

# Complexity

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Const for complexity of a word. So less expensive words can be learned faster. Gradualy we can introduce more more complex words for advanced speakers.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|-------------------------------
  1    |a, e, y, o, u         
  2    |i, l, m, n, j, h, w 
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, q
  4    |f, s, v, j, r, g, x 
  6    |ts, sh, ch, gu

**calculation**  
Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce total cost of the language. The better the cost, the better the language is and more easy to understand. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages not only for Maj.
