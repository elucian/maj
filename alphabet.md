# MAJ Alphabet

Maj is a Romance language. So it is using using 26 Lating letters: [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

```
--------------------------------------------------
A   B   K   D   E   F   G   H   Y   J   L   Q   C
a   b   k   d   e   f   g   h   y   j   l   q   c
--------------------------------------------------
M   N   O   P   R   S   X   T   U   I   W   V   Z    
m   n   o   p   r   s   x   t   u   i   w   v   z       
--------------------------------------------------
```

**notes:**

* the order of letters is different from ISO standard;
* for hand writing (script) Maj is using different letters;

## Capitalization

Maj uses both lowercase and uppercase letters from Latin alphabet. 

* Names are written with uppercase letters;
* Nouns are written with first capital letter;
* Other words are written with lowercase letters;

## Pronunciation

Alphabet pronunciation is inspired from [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

```

**Notes:**

* Maj has voiced, articulated and clear sounds easy to produce;
* Maj sounds are produced with your tongue behind your teeth;
* You will never bite yourself or spit around when you speak Maj;
* In total, Maj has 26 letters, but 28 basic sounds;


**Reference:**

We use phonetic symbols: 

* [IPA Org ](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 
* [IPA Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)

**Phonetic:**

Maj is a phonetic language, which means it’s written the way it sounds, and visa versa.

* Maj phonetic is enclosed with double quotes: MAJ:"fonetyk";
* IPA phonetic is enclosed with double quotes: IPA:"fonetik";
* English words are enclosed in double quotes: ENG:"phonetic";

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian, Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter `a`  is open central, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `y`  is close front, like first `y` in "yellow";
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

## Semi-vowels

Letters {i, w, h} are not vowels but almost.

_Letter `I`_ or `i`, is very different than English letter "i". It is closed-central and is very rarely used in English like group `eo`. The best ipa symbol for this letter is `ɨ` like "i" in "still";.


_Letter `W`:_ or `w`  is called soft `u`, is mostly used at beginning of words. It is pronounced "u" like "w" in "whiskey". It creates diphthongs: {"wa","we", "wy", "wo", "wu","wi"}. Single vowel after "w" is much longer than usual: 

* wa: "ua" (administration)
* wo: "uo" (surprise)
* wy: "ue" (happiness)
* we: "we" (sadness, cry)
* wu: "uu" (disapproval)
* wi: "uɨ" (disgusting)
* wh: "uə" (disgusting)

_Letter `H`:_ or `h` has two pronunciations: IPA: `ɦ` and IPA: `ə`, depending on it's position and sibling letters. In English the `h` is most of the time voiceless. In Maj it must have one of two pronunciations and is never silent.

1. Letter `h` is  `ɦ` at beginning of words like "h" in "hoard";
2. Letter `h` is  `ɦ` after a vowel, in the middle of words;
3. Letter `h` is  `ə` after a consonant like `e` in "after";
4. Letter `h` is  `ə` at end of words, even after vowels;

* veha = "vehicle" in this case `h` is `ɦ` like IPA:"veɦa"
* zhy  = "they"    in this case `h` is `ə` like IPA:"zə"

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `c`  is fricative, alveolar, like `ts` in "cats" or `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `j`  is palatal vibrated, similar to sound `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `q`  is alveoli-palatal like "ch" in words like "charm", "church", "chin";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `z`  is dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";

## Difficult sounds

That was the basics of alphabet. Maj is a phonetic language so what you write is what you read. This is difficult to do if you do not use cedillas and accents to aid with the renunciation. Therefore you must to understand the rules for reading and writing different sounds using a limited alphabet. 

**Digraphs**

Following letters are represented using digraphs in English.

* Letter `c` sounds `ts` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* Letter `q` sounds `tʃ` like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)
* Letter `x` sounds `ʂ`   like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)
* Letter `j` sounds `dʒ` like `gi` in  "giraffe";
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)

**Note:** Phonetic writing is using notation: IPA:"...".

**examples:** 

* qoka = ENG: "chocolate" => IPA:"qoka"    
* xava = ENG: "shovel"    => IPA:"ʂava"    
* koqa = ENG: "coach"     => IPA:"kot͡ɕa"  
* qyka = ENG: "girl"      => IPA:"t͡ɕika"  
* cita = ENG: "target"    => IPA:"t͡sɨta"  

**Modified: C**

Te Letter "c" sounds like Latvian "c" not English "c". It sounds like "ts" in English word "cats". The best IPA sound is: `t͡s` To make this sound you put you tang in "t" position and make a pitch sound "s" instead. 

1. English is inconsistent. Sometimes "c" is read "k", other times `ʂ` or `k`. Therefore in English you must learn how to "spell" correctly. Maj can be rad and write using _deterministic rules_. Once you have learned the rules you can read and write any Maj word.

**IPA practice**

* ENG: "chemical"  => IPA: "kemikəl"
* ENG: "chocolate" => IPA: "ʂoklət"

2. In English sounds "ce", "ci" is pronounced "se", "si", but in Maj, "c" is pronounced "ts" like in "cats".  Let's make exercise using Maj alphabet to write phonetic for two English words: 

* ceba = ENG: "cerebellum" => IPA: "tseba"
* ciga = ENG: "cigarette"  => IPA: "tsəga"

In Maj the groups {ca, ce, cy, co, cu} are also read {tsa, tse, tsy, tso, tsu}. To prevent this effect you must use letter "k" instead of "c". Notice uppercase "C" represent "carbon" element that is written "carba" = IPA:"t͡sarba" no need to write "karba".

**IPA practice**

* ceba => IPA:"tseba"
* ciga => IPA:"tsɨga"

**Modified: K**

Letter "k" is similar to "g" (plosive-valear) but  is not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in "culture" or "k" in "karate". Notice "k" is a very frequent letter in Maj and is used to replace "c" in most words. 

Maj words can starting with "k":

* ka = "not"  
* ke = "what" 

Special uses of "K" in science:

* Kg = Kilogram (metric unit);
* K  = Potassium chemical element;

**Alveolar: n*

Letter "N" or "n" at beginning of words is nasal-alveolar. To make this sound press the tip of the tongue on the rooftop of your mouth and voice using a vowel for example "no" like Eng: "north".

**Palette: n* 

Second "n" is soft when followed by vowel "e", in middle of words. It can sound like Spanish "ñ". IPA symbol for this sound is: "ɲ". This rule is not mandatory, "n" without softening is acceptable, it is the same word.

**Practice IPA:**

* nyna => IPA:"nyɲa"  = "child"
* nyne => IPA:"nyɲe"  = "children"
* pane => IPA:"pane"  = "breads" 

**Trilled R**

Letter "R" and "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 

**Valear J**

Letter "J", "j" is valear when used before vowels: {e, y}. That means your tongue front will vibrate softly. To make this sound your tongue is relaxed and the front of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times similar to "sh" with a vibration. The best symbol for this sound is IPA digraph: `dʒ`. 

* jela => IPA:"dʒela" = ENG: "jell"
* jyro => IPA:"dʒiro" = ENG: "around"

**Vibrated J** 

Letter "j" is pronounced different when followed by {a, o, i, u} semivowels {h, w} or consonant. In these cases "j" must be produced with the tip of your tongue softly pressed on rooftop of your mouse. Best IPA symbol for this sound is "ʒ".

* joka	=> IPA:"ʒoka" = game 
* yjma	=> IPA:"iʒma" = picture


**Plosive G**

Letter "G", "g" is plosive-uvular. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof of your mouth and produce a plosive sound like "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ", also known as "Hard G"

**Modified: Q**

In Maj, "Q" is used to create similar sound to Latvian "Č" = IPA:"tʃ". It sounds like "ch" in "chin" or "chicken". Letter "Q" replace digraph "ch", thus making the words shorter. For original "Qu" is replaced by "Qw". 

* Maj word "Qwyn" = ENG: "Queen" is read like IPA: "kwin";
* Maj word "aqwa" = ENG: "water" is read like IPA: "akwa";

**Modified: X**

Letters `X` and `x` are pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. You can avoid `ş` by using group `ks`.  To prodice "ş" sound you must softly press the middle of your tongue on the roof top of the mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. 

* Word: "xi" means "keep it quiet" similar to many languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʂue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written "Lucsemburg" in Maj to avoid reading "Luʂemburg" that will be incorrect;

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.

## Maj phonetic

You can learn how to read Maj by reading English words using Maj alphabet:

* cerebellum=> MAJ:"cerhbelim"       
* generator => MAJ:"jenereth"  
* pigeon    => MAJ:"pijin"      
* giraffe   => MAJ:"jyraf"      
* fusion    => MAJ:"fujhn"      
* guitar    => MAJ:"gytar"      
* geese     => MAJ:"gys"        
* cheese    => MAJ:"qyz"        
* chocolate => MAJ:"qoklht"     
* peach     => MAJ:"pyq"       
* speech    => MAJ:"spyq"      
* accident  => MAJ:"akcidh"     
* initial   => MAJ:"inyxhl"     
* fashion   => MAJ:"faxhn"    
* vehicle   => MAJ:"veykil"


## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 5 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated like "cc" in Maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used in words,

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs bj
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz cx
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

Combination of 2 consonants is expensive. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

x |a  |e  |y  |o  |u  | i | h 
--|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
a | · |ae |ay |ao |au | · | ·
e |ea | · |ey |eo |eu | · | eh
y |ya |ye | · |yo |yu |yi | yh
o |oa |oe |oy | · |ou | . | oh 
i | . | . |iy | . |iu | . | .
w |wa |we |wy |wo | · |wi | wh   

**Notes:**

* there is a total of 22 diphthongs in Maj
* u is replaced by w when is followed by a vowel
* diphthong are more frequent in 3 letter words
* presence of diphthong in a word increase its cost with 3 points

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis () optionals,
* V = Vowel, C = Constant
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* We use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```
rime     =  initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  =  V | C
nucleus  =  V | C | CC
coda     =  V 
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of word;
* start with one vowel: `VC`
* start with a consonant: `CV`
* start with two consonants: `CCV`
* end with two vowels: `CVV`

A syllable can not ...;

* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e y o u }
2. Syllable that have "coda" are used only for end of words;

**Patterns:**

* Two letter words: {`CV`, `VV`, `VC`} never {`CC`}
* Without penalty: {`VCV`, `CVC`} never {`CCC`}
* With cost penalty: {`VVC`, `VCC`, `CCV`, `CVV`}

**Weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to calculate a _cost_ that represents word complexity. More frequent words should have a lower cost. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words, rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, y, o, u, i 
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, x 
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, h  
  4    |v, j, r, z, k, g
  5    |q, w

**Cost:**  

We keep an aye on the word cost using an algorithm. The lower the cost, the better the language become. By using the same algorithm to other languages, we can compare _language complexity_. After a quick computation of only 500 samples Maj is about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

## Cost of typing

The cost of typing is different than speaking:

Cost |  Letter
-----|-------------------------------------------
  1  |a, s, d, f, j, k, l, g, h
  2  |q, w, e, r, u, i, o, p
  3  |z, x, c, v, m 
  4  |t, b, y, n 

**penalty:**

There is an extra cost of 2 for one hand letters.

Hand   | Letter
-------|------------------------------------------
left   |a,s,d,f,g,q,w,e,r,t,z,x,c,v,b
right  |h,j,k,l,y,u,i,o,p,n,m  

## Average cost

For computing an average cost, we consider 3 functions:

* tcos: cost of typing one word on keyboard 
* rcos: cost of reading and speaking with your voice
* wcos: cost of hand writing the word 

We use a priority average function, to evaluate average cost:

```
function cmaj(w as string) as integer
  cost = rcos(w)*3 + tcos(w)*2 + wcos(w) 
  cmaj  = cost/6
end function
```

CMaj function is available for open office macro, and is used in Lexicon:NOV tab to create new words.

## Word divergence:

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
j     | x
q     | c

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then one of the words must be changed or the words must be related. 

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
