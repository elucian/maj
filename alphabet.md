## Rarely used

{ X Q K W Y }

X = /ics/. can be used like in sex
Q = /kiu/. cam be used like in query
Q = /uou/. 

**K** can be used for /ki/. or /ke/. to avoid "chi", "che". Most of the time c is used.

**Q** 
Is most of the time used as { /qu/., /qe/. } but it can be replaced by { /ku/., /ki/., /ke/. }. It is not considered to be part of the Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh alphabets.  

**X**
It is a simplification of digraph /ks/. or /gz/. It is present in most romantic languages. In (maj)  is is used rarely and only in foreign words.

**Y**
Comes from Greek and is very frequent in English but not in other languages. Most of the time is used for neologism borrowed from English. I don't think is of any use in (maj).
