# MAJ Alphabet

Maj is using: [ISO Basic Latin Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

**uppercase**
```
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   Q 
M   N   O   P   R   S   T   U   V   X   Y   Z   W 
```

**lowercase**
```
a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   k   l  q 
m   n   o   p   r   s   t   u   v   x   y   z  w 
```

**Notes**

* There are 26 letters in Maj alphabet;

## Pronunciation

Maj alphabet is enhanced to maximize number of sounds and simplify spelling as much as possible.

* The alphabet is identical and restricted to Latin ISO standard;
* You add a short `ɨ` after each consonant like `eo` in "pidgeon";

```

## Phonetic alphabet

Phonetic symbols are from: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 

**Notes:** 

* Maj foreign words and phonetic is enclosing words in double quotes :"fonetic".
* Most names from other Romanic languages do not need phonetic translation;
* New York, Chicago or Washington are read correctly in Maj phonetic;

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian. Romanian and Spanish not English or German;

* Letter `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like first `i` in `initial`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;
* Leter  `y`  is polymorph it can be read `i`, `ɨ` or `ə`;

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `c`  is plosive palatal like "c" in "culture"
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten"
* Letter  `h`  is fricative, glottal like "h" in "hoard"
* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss"
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin"
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test"
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel"
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule"
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord"
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel"
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `j`  is palatal vibrated, similar to sound `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `z`  is dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey";
* Letter  `g`  is pronounced `ɢ` like `g` in "gees", "get", "guitar"
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";

## Rare letters

Two letters that are frequent in English but not used in Maj:

* Q is not used in regular words and is replaced by K most of the time
* W is not used and replaced by diphthongs: (ua, ue, ui, uo, uy)

## Digraphs

Two letters are join together in a new sound that is different than both letters. Maj digraphs are deterministic. That means the combination of these two letters can not be pronounced in any other way. 

* group `ts` sounds `t͡s` like in "its";
* group `ch` sounds `t͡ʃ` like in "peach"; 
* group `sh` sounds `ʂ`   like in "fashion";

**notes:** 

* Digraph `ch` is read `t͡ʃ` at the end of words; 
* Digraph `ch` is read ``ʂ`  when is used at beginning of words;
* Digraph `ch` can not be used in the middle of a word.

**c digraph**

Groups: {`ca`,`ce`,`ci,`co`,`cu`} are all digraphs similar to `ch`. 

* "Chicago" that is read "ʂicago" and not "t͡ʃicago";
* "coca"    is read "t͡ʃocə" and it means "chocolate";
* "coch"    is read "cot͡ʃ"  and it means "coach"

2. To avoid digraph formation Maj uses modified letters: {"x", "y", "k"} but not all digraphs can be avoided. For example Maj uses "y" to avoid digraph "io" then: "fashion" = "faxyn". Maj form of writing is much shorter than English.

## Difficult sounds

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter in Maj. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Vibrate J**

* Letter J in English "j" is "d͡ʒ";
* Letter J in Spanish is read like "h";
* Letter J in Maj is a "Soft: G" read like "ʒ"

Letter "J", "j" is labial vibrated before any vowel. That means your tongue tip will vibrate softly. To make this sound your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times similar to "sh" but vibrated. The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 


* "jela" = "jell" is pronounced "ʒela"
* "jaza" = "jaz"  is pronounced "ʒaza"

Letter J can be present anywhere in a word, even at the end of words:

* "RAJ"  = "Raj" is pronounced "raʒ" (person name)
* "Maj"  = "Maj" is pronounced "maʒ" (language name)

**Plosive G**

Letter "G", "g" is plosive uvular. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof of your mouth and produce a plosive sound like "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ", also known as "Hard G"

**Whistled C**

Letter "C", "c" is whistled when followed by {"a","e","i","o", "u", "y"}. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce a whistled sound like "ch". The best symbol for this sound is "t͡ʃ". To prevent this effect you must use "k" instead of "c".

**Plosive C**

Letter "C", "c" is pronounced "k" when followed by a consonant. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back mouth roof and produce a sound like "ck". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "k".

**Latin Q**

Latin Q must be followed by vowel `u` that is silent in most words. To make this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a sound like "k". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ku".

* que is going to be pronounced: "ke"
* qui is going to be pronounced: "ki"

Maj words do not use Q(q) letter. We replace Q with K except in names. 

* For example Queen  is not written "Kuin" it look too much with "King".
* For example Queens is a borough of New York City.


**Modified: X**

Letter `X` is pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. To avoid `ş` pronunciation letter `x` is replaced by `cs`.  To make this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top of the mouth and produce a sort whispered `s`. To make this sound correctly your tongue is more relaxed than for `s`. The best IPA symbols for this sound is "ʃ" but also similar "ʂ":

* Xue is pronounced "şue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is pronounced "Luşemburg" and represents name of a state/town;

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent state in 1867.

**Modified: Y**

Letter `Y` represents 3 sounds depending on the position in the word.

1. Sliding: "y" = `i` at the beginning of words like: York, Yes, Yacht;  
2. Covered: "i" = `ɨ` in the middle of words like "eo" in "pidgeon";
3. Covered: "a" = `ə` is used at end of words  like "ar" in "shugar";
   
Note: For nouns, terminal coda `y` is converted to `e` to make plural;

**Modified: K**

Letter "k" is used eliminate double `c` and help for creation of digraphs {"ca","ce","ci","co","cu"}. K is more frequent in Maj than in other languages but it's power is reduced by "q".

* `akcidy` = accident;
* `kesa`   = ceez;

**Modified: W**

Letter W is used at beginning of words and rarely used in the middle of the words.

* is pronounced "u" at beginning of words: wisol:"uisol" = "whiskey";
* inside of words can modify "e" that will be read "i" like in new:"niu" ;

##Voiced `h`

In some languages, "h" is silent but in Maj, h is usually voiced.

* Letter `h` is always voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is voiced when is following or preceding a vowel;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following a consonant;

**Notes** 

* Letter `h` can be used after `c` to make sound `t͡ʃ` like in word: `peach`.
* Letter `h` can be used after `s` to make sound `ʃ` like in word: `she`.

This convention is used only in names and foreign words that must be included in quotes "...". 

## English phonetic

We could write English words usnign Maj like this:

* its       :"its"
* she       :"xi"
* generator :"jeneretyr"
* pigeon    :"pijyn"
* giraffe   :"jiraf"
* fusion    :"fujyn"
* guitar    :"gitar"
* geese     :"gis"
* cheese    :"ciz"
* accident  :"acsidy" 
* chocolate :"coclyt"
* peach     :"pich"
* speech    :"spich"
* initial   :"inixyl"
* fashion   :"faxyn"
* yacht     :"iot"


## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 5 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated like "cc" in Maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used in words,

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs bj
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz cx
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

Combination of 2 consonants is expensive. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie |ii |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 
y | . | . |yi | . |yu| .  

Combination of 2 vowels is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "1".

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis () optionals,
* V = Vowel, C = Constant
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* We use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```
rime     =  initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  =  V | C 
nucleus  =  V | VV | CV
coda     =  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of word;
* start with one consonant otherwise;
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels;
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants;
* not all syllables have coda;

A syllable can not ...;

* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Syllable that have "coda" are used only for end of words;
3. Two words that have more then one syllable must sound different;

**Patterns:**

* Two letter words {`CV`, `VV`, `VC`, ~`CC`~}
* Three letter words {`VCV`, `VVC`, `VCC`, `CVV`, `CVC`}
* Four letter words starting with vowel: {`~VCVC~`, `VVCV`,`VCCV`,`VCVV`}
* Four letter words starting with consonant: {`CVCV`,`CCVV`,~`CVCC`~,~`CVVC`~}

**Weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to give a _cost_ for word complexity. Less expensive words can be learned faster and should be more frequent. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words that are rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u, y
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, h
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, g  
  4    |v, j, r, z, q, x
  5    |k, w

**Cost:**  

Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce cost. The lower the cost, the better the language is. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages, to compare language complexity. So far after a quick computation of 500 samples Maj is about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

**Word divergence:**

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then the words are sound alike. The sound alike words must represent the same thing. 

For noun "a"/"y"/"e", verb "u", adjective, adverb:"o" are sound alike. Therefore words must be distinguished with another letter to represent different words if they use sound-alike coda vowel. 

For words terminated in sound alike consonants: consonant, the words must differ with another letter in the middle, otherwise they will represent the same word. This rule can have exceptions but preferable not to.

The sound alike function is not yet created.

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
