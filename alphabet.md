# MAJ Alphabet

Maj is using: [ISO Basic Latin Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

**uppercase**
```
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M
N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   X   Y   W   Z   
```

**lowercase**
```
a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   k   l   m
n   o   p   q   r   s   t   u   v   x   y   w   z  
```

**Notes**

* There are 26 letters in Maj alphabet;

## Pronunciation

Maj alphabet is enhanced to maximize number of sounds and simplify spelling as much as possible.

* The alphabet is identical and restricted to Latin ISO standard;
* You add a short `ɨ` after each consonant like `eo` in "pidgeon";

```

## Phonetic alphabet

Phonetic symbols are from: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 

**Notes:** 

* Maj foreign words and phonetic is enclosing words in double quotes :"fonetic".
* Most names from other Romanic languages do not need phonetic translation;
* New York, Chicago or Washington are read correctly in Maj phonetic;

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian. Romanian and Spanish not English or German;

* Letter `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like first `i` in `initial`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;
* Letter `y`  is pronounced: `i` at beginning of words in names like: `New York`;
* Letter `y`  is pronounced: `ə` when used in middle or end of words;

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `c`  is plosive palatal like "c" in "culture"
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten"
* Letter  `q`  is plosive uvular like "q" in "quality"
* Letter  `h`  is fricative, glottal like "h" in "hoard"
* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss"
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin"
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test"
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel"
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule"
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord"
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel"
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `j`  is vibrated, similar to sound `si` in "fusion";
* Letter  `z`  is vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey".
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";

## Digraphs

There are not enough letters for all Maj sounds. Therefre some two letters are join together in a new sound that is different than both letters. Usuallt the combination of these two letters can not be pronounced in any other way but if it does there is another method to avoid digraph formation.

* sound `ts`  is `t͡s`  like `ts`  in "its";
* sound `sh`  is `ʂ`    like `sh`  in "fashion";
* sound `ch`  is `ʂ`    like `ch`  in "chocolate";
* sound `ce`  is `t͡ʃ`  like `ch`  in "chase"; 
* sound `ci`  is `t͡ʃ`  like `ch`  in "peach"; 
* sound `ge`  is `d͡ʒ`  like `ge`  in "general";
* sound `gi`  is `d͡ʒ`  like `gi`  in "Georgia";

## Determinism

Maj is a deterministic language. That means if someone tell you a new word you never heard before, you will be able to write it correctly without knowing its original spelling. Determinism is bidirectional, you can read a word without knowing its correct pronunciation. 

**notes:**

To avoid digraph formation Maj uses modified letters: {"x", "y", "q"} but not all digraphs can be avoided. For example Maj uses "y" to avoid digraph "io" then: "fashion" = "faxyn". Tgus is much shorter and deterministic.

## Difficult sounds

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter in Maj. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Vibrate J**

Letter "J", "j" is always trilled and voiced. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must press the tip of your tongue in the roof top and produce a frontal "sh". The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 

**Vibrate G**

Letter "G", "g" can be vibrated when follow by {"i","e"}. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the front roof and produce a voiced "dge" or "dgi". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "d͡ʒ" also known as "Soft G".

**Plosive G**

Letter "G", "g" is plosive when followed by {"a","o","u","y"} or consonant. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof of your mouth and produce a plosive sound like "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ", also known as "Hard G"

## Modified Letters

In some languages, we use tree-graphs to avoid digraph formation using silent letters {"u" or "h"}. Trigraphs will make the writing less efficient and difficult to read. To avoid this inconvenient Maj is using modified letters:

{C, W, Q, K, X, Y}

**Whistled C**

Letter "C", "c" is whistled when followed by {"i","e"}. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce a whistled sound like "ch". The best symbol for this sound is "t͡ʃ"

**Fricative C**

Letter "C", "c" can be pronounced "k" when followed by {'a','o','u','y'} or consonant. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a sound like "ca". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "k".

**Soft Q, unmodified**

Letter "Q", "q" is classic Latin, must be followed by vowel `u`. To make this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a sound like "kiu". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "q".

* aqua is going to be pronounced: "akua" and not "agua"
* aqui is going to be pronounced: "aki"  and not "acui"

**Hard Q, modified**

In Maj the letter "Q", "q" is pronounced "ɢ" when is follow by vowels {`e`, `i`}. To make this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof of the mouth and produce a sound like "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for these sounds are "ɢe", "ɢi".


**Whistled: X**

Letter `X` is pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. To avoid `ş` pronunciation letter `x` is replaced by `cs`.  To make this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top of the mouth and produce a sort whispered `s`. To make this sound correctly your tongue is more relaxed than for `s`. The best IPA symbols for this sound is "ʃ" but also similar "ʂ":

Note: X is not 100% deterministic for names. Therefore some names can be mispronounced:

* Xue is pronounced "şue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is pronounced "Lucsemburg" and represents name of a state/town;

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent state in 1867.

**Modified: Y**

Letter `Y` represents 2 sounds depending on the position in the word.

* `y` at the beginning of words is pronounced "i" like in New York, Yes, Yacht;
* `y` can be pronounced `ə` = `ă` like `io` in "fashion";   
* `y` at end of nouns is converted to `e` to make plural noun;

**Modified: K**

Rarely used only to replace `c` before a vowel or to avoid duplicate `c`.

* avpod duplication of "c" in words like `akcidy` instead of `accidy`;
* used before vowels to prevent formation of diphthongs: {`ke`, `ki`, `ko`, `ku`, 'ky'};

**Modified: W**

Letter W is used at beginning of words and rarely used in the middle of the words.

* is pronounced "u" at beginning of words: wisol:"uisol";
* inside of words can modify "e" that will be read "i" like in new:"niu" ;

**Double: ii**

Double "ii" sound like `eo` in "pigeon". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɨ".  To prevent digraph "ci" you write "kii" instead of "cii". Notice "ii" is similar to sound "y" but they are not exactly the same.

* kon una miina = one hand
* kon due miine = two hands

**Digraph: nn**

Double "nn" represent sound like "ñ" in Spanish "niños". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɲ".  

* kanna:"caɲa" = dog
* kanne:"caɲe" = dogs

## Silent `h`

Sometimes letter `h` is silent, some other times is voiced:

* Letter `h` is always voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is voiced when is following or preceding a vowel;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following after a consonant;

**Notes** 

* Letter `h` can be used after `c` to make sound `t͡ʃ` like in word: `peach`.
* Letter `h` can be used after `s` to make sound `ʃ` like in word: `she`.

In Romanian, `h` is used to prevent digraph formation in groups "che", "chi", "ghe", "ghi", this convention can not be used in Maj since it enters in conflict with English convention for digraph "ch" which is more popular. 

**Romanian:**

* `qe` = `ghe` like: "Gheorghe"
* `qi` = `ghi` like: "Gindă"
* `ke` = `che` like: "cheltuială"
* `ki` = `chi` like: "chitară"

**Examples:**

We could write English words usnign Maj like this:

* its       :"its"
* she       :"xi"
* generator :"generetyr"
* pigeon    :"pigyn"
* giraffe   :"giraf"
* fusion    :"fujyn"
* guitar    :"qitar"
* gees      :"gis"
* cheese    :"ciz"
* accident  :"aksidy" 
* chocolate :"cioclyt"
* peach     :"pici"
* speech    :"spici"
* initial   :"inixyl"
* fashion   :"faxyn"
* yacht     :"iot"


## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 5 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated in maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz 
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft fj
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

Combination of 2 consonants is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 

Combination of 2 vowels is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "1".

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals,
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong,
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```python

# syllable structure
rime     ::= initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  ::=  C 
nucleus  ::=  V | VV | CV
coda     ::=  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of words
* start with one consonant otherwise
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels 
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants
* not all syllables have coda

A syllable can not ...;

* contain `h` after a consonant,
* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vowels can be used at beginning of words: { y w }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words
4. Two words that have more then one syllable must sound different

**weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Cost for word complexity. So less expensive words can be learned faster and should be more frequent. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words that are more rarely used.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u, y
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, h
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, g  
  4    |v, j, r, z, k, x
  5    |q, w

**cost:**  

Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce cost. The lower the cost, the better the language is. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages, to compare language complexity. So far after a quick computation of 500 samples Maj is about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

**Word divergence:**

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
a     | y
e     | i
j     | x

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then the words are sound alike. The sound alike words must represent the same thing. 

For noun "a"/"y","e", verb "u", adjective, adverb:"o" are sound alike. Therefore words must be distinguished with another letter to represent different words if they use sound-alike coda vowel. 

For words terminated in sound alike consonants: consonant, the words must differ with another letter in the middle, otherwise they will represent the same word. This rule can have exceptions but preferable not to.

The sound alike function is not yet created.

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
