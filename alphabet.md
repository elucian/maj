**Notes:**

* Maj has voiced, articulated and clear sounds easy to produce;
* Maj sounds are produced with your tongue behind your teeth;
* You will never bite yourself or spit around when you speak Maj;

**Reference:**

We use phonetic symbols: 

* [IPA Org ](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 
* [IPA Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)

**Phonetic:**

* Maj phonetic is enclosed with double quotes: MAJ:"fonetik";
* IPA phonetic is enclosed with double quotes: IPA:"fonetic";
* English words are enclosed in double quotes: ENG:"phonetic";

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian. Romanian and Spanish not English or German;

* Letter `a`  is open central, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like first `i` in `initial`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

## Semi vowels

Maj has two semivowels: {y, v}

_Letter `Y`:_ is pronounced different depending on its position.

1. Initial position: "y" = `ʎ` at the beginning of words like: "yet", "yellow";  
2. First   position: "ŷ" = `ɨ` in the middle of words like "eo" in "pigeon";
3. Second  position: "ў" = `ə` or at end of words sounds like "ar" in "sugar";
   
**Notes: **

* Maj is using "y" or "Y" at beginning of words not "i" nor "I";
* Maj letters "ŷ", "ў" can be present in elevated writings (story books);

_Letter `W`:_  is called soft `u`, is mostly used at beginning of words. It is pronounced "u" like "w" in "whiskey". It creates diphthongs: {"wa","we", "wi", "wo", "wu","wy"}. The vowel after "w" is much longer than usual: 

* wa: "uaa" (administration)
* wo: "uoo" (surprise)
* wy: "uəə" (disgusting)
* wi: "uee" (happiness)
* we: "wee" (sadness)
* wu: "uuu" (disapproval)

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `c`  is fricative, alveolar, like `ts` in "cats" or `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `h`  is fricative, glottal like "h" in "hoard"
* Letter  `j`  is palatal vibrated, similar to sound `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `q`  is alveoli-palatal like "ch" in words like "charm", "church", "chin";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `z`  is dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";

## Difficult sounds

That was the basics of alphabet. Maj is a phonetic language so what you write is what you read. This is difficult to do if you do not use cedillas and accents to aid with the renunciation. Therefore you must to understand the rules for reading and writing different sounds using a limited alphabet. 

**Digraphs**

Specific groups of two letters can be pronounced different than both letters. Maj digraphs are redundant though. That means the combination of these two letters must be replaced by another letter. This makes Maj words shorter than English words. 

* group `ts` = `c` sounds `t͡s` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* group `ch` = `q` sounds `t͡ʃ` like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolo-palatal_affricate)
* group `sh` = `x` sounds `ʂ`   like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)
* group `ji` = `ʒ` sounds `d͡ʒi` like `gi` in  "giraffe";
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)
* group `je` = `ʒ` sounds `d͡ʒe` like `ge` in  "generator";

You can use digraphs in _phonetic Maj writing_ that is using pattern: MAJ:"...".

**examples:** 

* xoka = "chocolate" => IPA:"ʂoka"    = MAJ: "shoka"
* xava = "shovel"    => IPA:"ʂava"    = MAJ: "shava"  
* koqa = "coach"     => IPA:"kot͡ɕa"  = MAJ: "kocha"
* qika = "girl"      => IPA:"t͡ɕika"  = MAJ: "chika"
* cita = "target"    => IPA:"t͡sita"  = MAJ: "tsita"

**Modified: C**

Te Letter "c" sounds more like Latvian "c" than English "c". This sound like "ts" in English word "kats". The best IPA sound is: `t͡s` [listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate). To make this sound you put you tang in "t" position and try to make a pitch sound "s" instead. 

1. English is inconsistent. Sometimes "c" is read "k", other times `ʂ` or `k`. Therefore in English you must learn how to "spell" correctly. Maj can be rad and write using _deterministic rules_. So once you have learned the rules you can read and write any word written with Maj alphabet.

* ENG: "chemical"  => IPA: "kemikəl"
* ENG: "chocolate" => IPA: "ʂoklət"

2. In English sounds "ce", "ci" is pronounced "se", "si", but in Maj, "c" is pronounced "t͡s" like "ts" in "cats".  Let's make exercise using Maj alphabet to write phonetic for two English words: 

* ceba = ENG: "cerebellum" => IPA: "t͡serəbelum"
* ciga = ENG: "cigarette"  => IPA: "t͡sigəret"

In Maj the groups {ca, ce, ci, co, cu} are also read {t͡sa, t͡se, t͡si, t͡so, t͡su}. To prevent this effect you must use letter "k" instead of "c". Uppercase "C" also represent "carbon" chemical element that is written "carba" = IPA:"t͡sarba" no need to write "karba" this could be confusing since "K" = "kaola" si for potassium.

* ceba => MAJ:"tseba"
* ciga => MAJ:"tsiga"

**Modified: K**

Letter "k" is used to avoid double "c". Therefore "cc" is written "kc". This letter is similar to "g" (plosive-valear) but  is not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in Eng: "culture" or "k" in Eng:"karate". 

Some Maj words starting with "k":

* ka = "not?"  
* ke = "what?" 
* ki = "who?"  

Special uses of "K" in science:

* Kg = Kilogram (metric unit);
* K  = Potassium chemical element;

**Palatal: ñ* 

Letter "ñ" is inherited from Spanish. It can be used in Maj phonetics but in normal writing is not used, nor necessary. This sound can be produced when "n" is last letter in word and followed by a vowel. IPA symbol for "ñ" is: "ɲ". 

* nina => MAJ:"niña"  = "child"
* nine => MAJ:"niños" = "children"
* pane => MAJ:"pañe"  = "breads" (plural)

**Alveolar: n*

Letter "N" or "n" at beginning of words is nasal-alveolar. To make this sound press the tip of the tongue on the rooftop of your mouth and voice using a vowel for example "no" like Eng: "north".


**Trilled R**

Letter "R" and "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 

Letter "R" do not control pronunciation of neighbor vowels. So "ar" is not pronounced "ər" like in English. To make "ər" sound you must use "ўr" but is not used in casual chat. 

**Vibrate J**

Letter "J", "j" is labial vibrated when used before vowels. That means your tongue tip will vibrate softly. To make this sound your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times similar to "sh" but vibrated. The best symbol for this sound is d͡ʒ. 

* jela => IPA:"d͡ʒela" = ENG: "jell"
* jaza => IPA:"d͡ʒaza" = ENG: "jaz" 

**Plosive G**

Letter "G", "g" is plosive uvular. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof of your mouth and produce a plosive sound like "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ", also known as "Hard G"

**Modified: Q**

In Maj, "Q" is used to create similar sound to Latvian "Č" = IPA:"t͡ɕ". It sounds like "ch" in "chin" or "chicken". Letter "Q" replace digraph "ch", thus making the words shorter. For original "Q" is replaced by "kw".

* Maj word "Kwin" = "Queen" is read like IPA: "kwin";
* Maj word "akwa" = "water" is read like IPA: "akwa";

**Modified: X**

Letters `X` and `x` are pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. You can avoid `ş` by using group `cs`.  To prodice "ş" sound you must softly press the middle of your tongue on the roof top of the mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. 

* Word: "sh" means "keep it quiet" similar to many languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʂue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written "Lucsemburg" in Maj to avoid "ʂ";

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.


##Voiced `h`

Letter "h" is usually voiced but sometimes, silent.

* Letter `h` is voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following a consonant;
* Letter `h` is used after {`c`, `s`, `t`} to make digraph.

## Maj phonetic

You can learn English pronunciation by using Maj phonetic alphabet:

* cerebellum=> MAJ:"cerəbelum"       
* generator => MAJ:"jeneretўr"  
* pigeon    => MAJ:"pijŷn"      
* giraffe   => MAJ:"jiraf"      
* fusion    => MAJ:"fujўn"      
* guitar    => MAJ:"gitar"      
* geese     => MAJ:"gis"        
* cheese    => MAJ:"qiz"        
* accident  => MAJ:"aksidў"     
* chocolate => MAJ:"xokclў"     
* peach     => MAJ:"pich"       
* speech    => MAJ:"spich"      
* initial   => MAJ:"ynixўl"     
* fashion   => MAJ:"faxўn"      

## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 5 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated like "cc" in Maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used in words,

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs bj
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz cx
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

Combination of 2 consonants is expensive. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie |ii |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 
y | . | . |yi | . |yu| .  

Combination of 2 vowels is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "1".

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis () optionals,
* V = Vowel, C = Constant
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* We use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```
rime     =  initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  =  V | C 
nucleus  =  V | VV | CV
coda     =  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of word;
* start with one consonant otherwise;
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels;
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants;
* not all syllables have coda;

A syllable can not ...;

* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Syllable that have "coda" are used only for end of words;
3. Two words that have more then one syllable must sound different;

**Patterns:**

* Two letter words {`CV`, `VV`, `VC`, ~`CC`~}
* Three letter words {`VCV`, `VVC`, `VCC`, `CVV`, `CVC`}
* Four letter words starting with vowel: {`~VCVC~`, `VVCV`,`VCCV`,`VCVV`}
* Four letter words starting with consonant: {`CVCV`,`CCVV`,~`CVCC`~,~`CVVC`~}

**Weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to give a _cost_ for word complexity. Less expensive words can be learned faster and should be more frequent. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words that are rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u, y 
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, x 
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, h  
  4    |v, j, r, z, k, g
  5    |q, w

**Cost:**  

Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce cost. The lower the cost, the better the language is. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages, to compare language complexity. So far after a quick computation of 500 samples Maj is about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

**Word divergence:**

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then the words are sound alike. The sound alike words must represent the same thing. 

For noun "a"/"y"/"e", verb "u", adjective, adverb:"o" are sound alike. Therefore words must be distinguished with another letter to represent different words if they use sound-alike coda vowel. 

For words terminated in sound alike consonants: consonant, the words must differ with another letter in the middle, otherwise they will represent the same word. This rule can have exceptions but preferable not to.

The sound alike function is not yet created.

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
