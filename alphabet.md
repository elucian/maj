## Rarely used

{ I X K W Q Y}

**X** 
* instead of x we use /ks/ at the end of words For example "sex" is written "seks".
* But x is used for   /xe/. and /xi/.

**K** 
* can be used for /ki/. or /ke/. to avoid "chi", "che" in names.
* also keep the "K" from respect for physics and to preserve kilo word. 

**Y**
Comes from Greek and is very frequent in English but not in other languages. Most of the time is used for neologism borrowed from English. In (maj) "i" is used at the beginning of words, "y" is used at the end of words to transform a word into an attribute.

For example: "sex" will be "sexy" not "sexi". 

**I**
Since I looks luke "l" it will not be used. Instead we will use "Y" to replace "I" That is what "Y" is only used for. A word starting with "i" will be converted in Y at the beginning of any proposition. Propositions start with capital letters.

## Unused Q

**Q** 
Is most of the time used as { /qu/., /qe/. } but it can be replaced by { /ku/., /ki/., /ke/. }. It is not considered to be part of the Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh alphabets. 

Q letter is not part of any word in (maj).

## Phoneme

Two letters close by that are pronounced in unique way are called phoneme. Phonemes have 2 or 3 vowels together.

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u
--|---|---|---|---|----
a |   |ae |ai |ao |au
e |ea |   |ei |eo |eu
i |ia |ie |   |io |iu
o |oa |oe |oi |   |ou
u |ua |ue |ui |uo |

## Syllables

Any combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. Each word must contain at least one syllable.

**Last:** Words can end with "y":
