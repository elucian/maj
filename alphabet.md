# Alphabet

Maj is using: [ISO Basic Latin Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

**uppercase**
```
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M
N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   X   Y   Z   W
```

**lowercase**
```
a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   K   l   m
n   o   p   q   r   s   t   u   v   x   y   z   w
```

**Notes**

* There are 26 letters in Maj alphabet;

## Pronunciation

Reading the alphabet is different from other Romantic Languages:

* In Maj you add a short `ɨ` sound after consonants like "eo" from "pigeon";
* Exceptions: `k`, is pronounced `ka` and `q` is pronounced `kiu`;
* Completly unrelated words can differ by just one letter;
* Most letters are pronounced the same in all words with some exceptions;
* Most letters are voiced in Maj words except `h` that can be sometime silent;


```

nɨ   o   pɨ  kiu rɨ  sɨ  tɨ  u   vɨ  ʃɨ  ɨ   zɨ  uɨ
----------------------------------------------------
```

## Cedilla

Though elegant and useful in other languages, Maj do not use cedilla:

* { î â ă ö ü é è ç ş ţ ...}

**notes**

* Most names from other Romanic languages do not need phonetic translation,
* New York, Chicago or Washington are read correctly in Maj,
* France is accepted but "française" should be translated to "francez".

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian. Romanian and Spanish not English or German;

* Letter `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in "car";
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in "melon";
* Letter `i`  is close front, like first `i` in "initial";
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;
* Letter `y`  is pronounced: `i`, `ɨ` or `ə` depending on position;

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `j`  is trilled, similar to sound `si` in "fusion";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `z`  is trilled similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled similar to `rr` in "Africa";
* Letter  `v`  is trilled like `v` in "vehicle";
* Letter  `g`  is plosive uvular like `g` in "gees", "guitar", "get";
* Letter  `k`  is fricative `c` like `k` in "sky";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or `sh` in "fashion";
* Letter  `y`  is pronounced `i`, `ɨ` or `ə` depending on position in the word;
* Letter  `q`  is pronounced `k` or `G` depending on position in the word;
* Letter  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey" but is very rare.


**Notation**

I have try to use: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)
notation to represent special Maj sounds.

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter of the Maj language. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Trilled J**

Letter "J", "j" is always trilled. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must press the tip of your tongue in the roof top and produce a voiced "sh". The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 

**Whistled C**

Letter "C", "c" is whistled when followed by one of {`e`,`i`,`h`}. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce a fricative "ch". The best symbol for this sound is "t͡ʃ"

**Fricative Q**

Letter "Q", "q" is pronounced "ɢ" when followed by {`e`, `i`}. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a fricative voiced "gue" or "gui". The best symbol for this sound is "ɢ".

Letter "Q" follow by "u" is pronounced "k". So the "que" or "qui" is read "ke" and "ki" instead of "gue" and "gui". That is inconvenient bu no writing is perfect so we have this exception.

## Digraphs

Some sounds are created using two letters different than both. 

maj| romanian | phonetic(*)  
---|----------|--------------
ts | ţ        | t͡s
sh | ş        | ʃ
ch | ce,ci    | t͡ʃ
ce | ce       | t͡ʃe
ci | ci       | t͡ʃi
ge | ge       | d͡ʒe
gi | gi       | d͡ʒi
qe | ghe      | ɢe
qi | ghi      | ɢi

 
**description:**

* sound `ts`  is `t͡s` like `t's` in "cats";
* sound `ce`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "chase"; 
* sound `ci`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "peach";
* sound `ch`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "chocolate";
* sound `sh`  is `ʃ`   like `sh`  in "fashion";
* sound `ge`  is `d͡ʒ` like `ge`  in "Georgia";
* sound `gi`  is `d͡ʒ` like `gi`  in "Georgia";

**Note:** Digraphs are rarely used in Maj!

## Silent `h`

Sometimes letter `h` is silent, some other times is voiced:

* Letter `h` is always voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is voiced when is following or preceding a vowel;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following after a consonant;

**Notes** 

* Letter `h` can be used after `c` to make sound `t͡ʃ` like in word: `peach`.
* Letter `h` can be used after `s` to make sound `ʃ` like in word: `she`.

In Romanian, `h` is used to prevent digraph formation in groups "che", "chi", "ghe", "ghi", this convention can not be used in Maj since it enters in conflict with English convention which is more popular. However Maj has 2 digraphs not available in English:

For Romanians:

* sound `qe` = sound `ghe`
* sound `gi` = sound `ghi`
* sound `ke` = sound `che`
* sound `ki` = sound `chi`

## Modified Letters

{W, Q, K, X, Y}

**Rarely used: W**
* can be present only at beginning of words: for example: "whiskey".
* inside or at end of words we always use "u" not "w".

**Modified: Q** 

Maj has a special use for Q:

* At beginning of words `Q` is similar pronounced like `qu` in Latin alphabet,
* In the middle of the words is pronounced "ɢ" like "g" in "rogue",
* After `q` you can use {`e`,`i`} to create diphthongs "ge", "gi".

For example: "aqua" is going to be pronounced: "agua"

Note: Q is not present in following alphabets:

* Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, 
* Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
* Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, 
* Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh. 

**Modified: X**
* In names `x` is pronounced `cs` like in all other Romanic languages: Luxemburg = Lucsemburg
* In maj words, `x` is pronounced like: `ʃ` and is replacement for `sh` in long words;
* In some words, letter `x` is replaced by `cs`, to avoid `ʃ` pronunciation if this is the case;


**Modified: Y**
* `y` at the beginning of words is pronounced "i" like in New York, Yes, Yacht;
* `y` can be pronounced `ɨ` like `eo` in "pigeon" or `io` in "fashion";   
* `y` at end of words is pronounced `ə` like `a` in "chocolate";
* `y` at end of nouns is converted to `a` or `e` to make articulated nouns;

**Modified: K**
* `k` is used to avoid duplicate letter `c` in words like `akcidy`;
* `k` is used before {`e`,`i`} to prevent formation of diphthongs: {`ke`, `ki`};

## Phonetic examples

If we were to use Maj alphabet we could write some English words like this:

she       => xe
generator => generetyr
pigeon    => pigiyn
giraffe   => giraf
fusion    => fujyn
guitar    => qitar
gees      => qis
cheese    => ciz
accident  => akcidynt 
chocolate => cioclyt
peach     => pici
speech    => spici
initial   => inixyl  
fashion   => faxyn
yacht     => yaht

## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 4 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated in maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz 
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft fj
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 


## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals,
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong,
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```python

# syllable structure
rime     ::= initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  ::=  C 
nucleus  ::=  V | VV | CV
coda     ::=  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of words
* start with one consonant otherwise
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels 
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants
* not all syllables have coda

A syllable can not ...;

* contain `h` after a consonant,
* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vowels can be used at beginning of words: { y w }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words
4. Two words that have more then one syllable must sound different

**Sound alike:**

Some people may pronounce the letters in a wrong way that is not very clear. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters when these letters are the only difference between two words so that words can be more distinctive from each other.

sound | alike
------|----------
v     | b
r     | l
i     | y
e     | y
e     | i
x     | s

**weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Cost for word complexity. So less expensive words can be learned faster and should be more frequent. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words that are more rarely used.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u, y
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, h
  2    |b, c, d, p, t, g  
  3    |v, j, r, z, x, k 
  4    |q, w 

**cost:**  

Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce cost. The better the cost, the better the language is and more easy to use. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages, to analyze a language complexity and compare other languages with Maj.

**algorithm**

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

```basic
REM  *****  BASIC  *****

sub main
   let x = wcost("barca")
   print x
end sub

function belong(x, target)
  belong = InStr(target, x) <> 0
end function

function wcost(w as string)
  let r = 0     
  let c = 0
  let consonant = "bcdfghjklmnprstvxzw"  
  let vowel = "aeiouy"
  let prev  = "none"
  rem compute cost
  for i = 1 to len(w)
     x = mid(w,i,1)
     rem basic cost
     if belong(x,"aeiouy") then let c = 1
     if belong(x,"lmnfsh") then let c = 2 
     if belong(x,"bcdptg") then let c = 2 
     if belong(x,"vjrzxk") then let c = 3 
     if belong(x,"qw")     then let c = 4 
     let r = r + c
     rem extra cost
     if belong(x, consonant) then        
        if prev = "consonant" then
           let r = r + 5 rem double consonant
        else
           prev = "consonant"   
        end if   
     else
        if prev = "vowel" then
           let r = r + 2 rem double vowel
        else   
           let prev = "vowel"      
        end if   
     end if            
  next
  wcost = r 
end function```

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
