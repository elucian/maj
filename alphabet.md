## Pronunciation

Maj pronunciation is simple and easy to learn. It has well defined phonetic rules, no need to spell words;

* Maj sounds require healthy tongue, lips, teeth and vocal chords;
* Maj sounds do not require to put your tongue between your teeth;
* Maj sounds do not require inverted tongue tip (retroflex);
* Maj has strong consonants and clear vowels similar to Portuguese;
* You will never byte your tongue or spit around by speaking Maj;

**Tools:**

Maj has some tools for beginners to learn how to read and write correctly:

* Maj IPA: [phonetics](https://lingojam.com/MajIPA)
* Maj script: [convertor](https://lingojam.com/MajScript)

**Reference:**

For explaining the alphabet pronunciation we have used phonetic symbols: 

* [IPA Org ](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 
* [IPA Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)

**Phonetic:**

Phonetic notation has language prefix and is enclosed in double quotes like this:

* Maj phonetic: MAJ:"word";
* IPA phonetic: IPA:"word";
* English phonetic: ENG:"word";

IPA phonetic is used only in Maj documentation. Maj phonetic is used only in training text. For chat you can use normal letters. English phonetic can be used to compare Maj with English.


## Vowels

Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } and three semi-vowels: {ə, y, w}:

method      |front    |central    |back 
------------|---------|-----------|---------
close       |i        |y          |u      
close mid   |e        |           |o
mid         |         |ə          |
open        |a        |           |
approximate |         |w          | 

**Origin:**

Next 5 vowels are pronounced like in Italian and Romanian languages:

* Letter `a`  is open central, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like `ee` in `geese`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;
* Letter `ə`  is mid central, like `o` in baron;

**Letter `y`:** Is close central, un-rounded vowel. IPA symbol for this sound is actually "y". This sound is very different than English sound `y`. It is very similar to sound `i` in words "still" or "director".

* zyna = "fairy"

**Letter `h`:** has two pronunciations depending on its position in word and previous letter:

* `h` at beginning of words or after a vowel sounds like "h" in "hoard";
* `ə` at the end of words or after a consonant sounds like `e` in "after";

Since on QUERTY KEYBOARD there is not `ə` you can use "h" instead.

* veha = "vehicle" in this case `h` is `ɦ` like IPA:"veɦa"
* zhi  = "they"    in this case `h` is `ə` like IPA:"zəi"

**Letter `w`:** is called soft `u`. It is pronounced like "w" in "whiskey". You can use `w` before a vowel but not before a consonant. This letter is not closed and not open but tranzitional, aproximand. In some languages this letter is considered consonant.

**interjections:**

Two letter words starting with "w" and one vowel are called interjections. In these words the vowel is a little bit longer than usual but is not duplicated. We do not write: waaa! but wa!

* wa! (administration)
* wo! (surprise)
* wi! (happiness)
* we! (sadness, cry)
* wu! (disapproval)
* wh! (disgusting)

Observe that wh ia pronounced IPA:"wə"

## Tone and accent

Maj vowels can be pronounced with one of two tones: Low tone and Higher tone: 

**word ending**

* If a word is ending with space, "." or ";" you can use lower tone for last vowel;
* If a word is ending with comma, "," or "?" you should use higher tone for last vowel;

**sentence ending**

Symbols: "!" and "?" are altering the last vowel of the last word. 

* Using "!" will make a lower tone for last vowel;
* Using "?" will make a higher tone for last vowel;

For question mark: You should pronounce a longer vowel and gliding the tone from lower to higher level. Wehn the word is ending with a consonant, the vowel in front of the last consonant is modified.

**accent:**

Maj words have a constant accent. Usually the first vowel in a word is a bit stronger then the other vowels. This can be changed if the vowel has an accent over it. In this case only one vowel can have an accent. It becomes a bit stronger than the normal tone.

* Grave accent can be used to stress a letter: {à è ì ò ù};
* Letter "h" is read "ə" but it can not have an accent; 

## Consonants

Maj is using 19 consonants:

method   | bilabial| labio dental | alveolar | valar | post alveolar | glottal 
---------|---------|--------------|----------|-------|---------------|----------
plosive  | p,b     |              | t, d     | k, g  |               |
nasal    | m       |              | n        |       |               |
trill    |         |              | r        |       |               | 
fricative|         | f,v          | s,z      |       | x, j          | ɦ
lateral  |         |              | l        |       |               |
affricate|         |              | c        |       | q             |


Most consonants are similar to: Italian and Romanian but are similar to in English;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `k`  is voiceless velar stop like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `v`  is fricative vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `z`  is alveolar-dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "ashes" or "fashion";
* Letter  `j`  is fricative-post alveolar, like `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `c`  is alveolar affricate, like `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `q`  is voiceless post-alveolar affricate like "ch" in "church";
* Letter  `g`  is voiced velar fricative like `gu` in "guitar";
* Letter  `h`  is voiced fricative glottal before vowels like "h" in "happy";


## Difficult sounds

You should be familiar with most of these sounds if you speak English. However the sounds in Maj are associated differently with the letters. Next you will learn the rules to make Maj sounds.

**Digraphs**

Most frequent digraphs are associate with letters:

* Letter `c` sounds `t͡s` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* Letter `q` sounds `t͡ʃ` or ʈ͡ʂ like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)
* Letter `x` sounds `ʃ` or `ʂ` like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_fricative)
* Group `dj` sounds `d͡ʒ` like `g` in  "giraffe": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)

**Examples:** 
Phonetic writing is quoted using IPA: notation 

* qoka => IPA:"t͡ʃoka"  = "chocolate"   
* xava => IPA:"ʃava"    = "shovel"    
* koqa => IPA:"kot͡ʃa"  = "coach"     
* qika => IPA:"t͡ʃika"  = "girl"      
* cita => IPA:"t͡sita"  = "target"
* djia => IPA:"d͡ʒia"   = "day"
* adja => IPA:"ad͡ʒa"   = "today"

**Modified: c**

Maj letter "c" sounds like Latvian "c" not English "c". It sounds like `t͡s` in English word "cats". To make this sound you put you tang in "t" position and make a pitch sound "s" instead. Group `ts` is actually never used in Maj.

**IPA practice**
* ceba = ENG: "cerebellum" => IPA: "t͡seba"
* ciga = ENG: "cigarette"  => IPA: "t͡siga"

**Modified: k**

Maj letter "k" is plosive-valear not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in "culture" or "k" in "karate". Notice "k" is a very frequent letter in Maj. 

**examples:**

* akwa = "water";
* qoka = "chocolate";

**Trilled: r**

Letter "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 


**Modified: q**

In Maj, "Q" is used to create IPA sound:"t͡ʃ". It sounds like "ch" in "chin" or "chicken" or "peach". This replace digraph "ch", thus making the Maj words shorter.

* qyka = "girl" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃika";
* qesa = "ceez" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃesa";
* qoka = "chocolate" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃoka";

**Note:** In many Romance alphabets this letter is restricted. It must be followed by vowel "u". In Maj we eliminate this restriction. Letter "q" can be followed by any vowel or semivowel but can not be followed by a consonant.

**Modified: x**

Letters `x` sounds like: `sh` in `sheep`. To prodice this sound you must softly press the middle of the tongue on the roof top of your mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. In most other Romance languages this sound is "cs" but Maj has repurpose this letter.

* Word: "xi" means "keep it quiet" similar to many Romance languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʃue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written Luxemburg and is read "Luʃemburg" in Maj;

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.

## Clusters

A clusters represents a group of two consonants. 

**Rules:**

* same letter can not be used twice in a cluster;
* some combinations can not be pronounced;
* clusters of 3 consonants are forbidden;

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these clusters are usable in Maj words:

```
br bs bj
kl km kn kr ks kt kv kz kx
dl dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lk ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nk nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rk rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
jb jk jd jl jm jn jr js jt jv 
gn gl gm gr gv gs
``` 

## Diphthongs

Two vowels combined together into one cluster are called diphthongs.

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u  | y 
--|---|---|---|---|---|---
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au |ay 
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu |ey 
i |ia |ie | . |jo |iu |iy 
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou |oy 
w |wa |we |wi |wo |.  |wy 
y |ya |ye |iy |yo |yu | . 

 
## Letter weight 

Sounds are more or less difficult to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to calculate _pronounciation complexity_ for a word. More frequent words should have a lower complexity. 

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |aeyiou 
  2    |lmnfsx 
  3    |bkdpt 
  4    |vjrzc
  5    |hgqw


## Cost of typing

The cost of typing on keyboard is different than speaking the word:

Cost |  Letter
-----|-------------------------------------------
  1  |asdfjklgh
  2  |qweruiop
  3  |zxcvm 
  4  |tbyn

**penalty:**

There is an extra cost of 2 for same hand consecutive letters.

Hand   | Letter
-------|------------------------------------------
left   |asdfgqwertzxcvb
right  |hjklyuiopnm  

## Average cost

For computing an average cost, we consider 3 functions:

* tcos: cost of typing one word on keyboard 
* rcos: cost of reading and speaking with your voice
* wcos: cost of hand writing the word 

We use a priority average function, to evaluate average cost:

```
function cmaj(w as string) as integer
  cost = rcos(w)*3 + tcos(w)*2 + wcos(w) 
  cmaj  = cost/6
end function
```

CMaj function is available for open office macro, and is used in Lexicon:NOV tab to create new words.

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Word divergence:

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
j     | x
q     | c

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then one of the words must be changed or the words must be related. 

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 3
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 1

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for 542 words:

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
