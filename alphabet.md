# MAJ Alphabet

Maj alphabet has 28 letters. For each letter there is an unique name but there are two exceptions: Letter g and letter h have two distinct pronunciations but only one name each. So Maj have only 26 names actually for the letters. Script alphabet is mapped to Latin alphabet. So Maj actually has two set of symbols for the alphabet one is the Latin symbol and the other one is the Maj symbol.

**notes:**
* the order of letters is different from ISO standard;
* name if letters start with the letter it represents;
* each letter represent one sound except `g` and `h`;
* for handwriting see details on: [script](script.md) page;

## Pronunciation

* Maj sounds are influenced by Central European languages;
* Maj sounds require healthy tongue, lips, teeth and vocal chords;
* Maj is an articulate language with strong consonants and clear vowels;
* Maj sounds do not require to put your tongue between your teeth;
* Maj sounds do not require inverted tongue tip (retroflex);
* Maj has deterministic phonetic rules, no need to spell words;
* You will never byte your tongue or spit arround by speaking Maj;

**Tools:**

Maj has some tools for beginners to learn how to read and write correctly:

* Maj IPA: [phonetics](https://lingojam.com/MajIPA)
* Maj script: [convertor](https://lingojam.com/MajScript)

**Reference:**

For explaining the pronunciation we have used phonetic symbols: 

* [IPA Org ](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 
* [IPA Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)

**Phonetic:**

Phonetic notation has language prefix and is enclosed in double quotes like this:

* Maj phonetic: MAJ:"word";
* IPA phonetic: IPA:"word";
* English phonetic: ENG:"word";

## Vowels

Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } and three semi-vowels: {y, h, w}:

method     |front    |central    |back 
-----------|---------|-----------|---------
close      |i        |y          |u      
close mid  |e        |           |o
mid        |         |ə          |
open       |a        |           |
aproximant |         |w          | 

**Italian:**

Next 5 vowels are pronounced like in Italian and Romanian languages:

* Letter `a`  is open central, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like `ee` in `geese`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

**Letter `y`:** Is close central, unrounded vowel. IPA symbol for this sound is actually "ɨ". This sound is very different than English sound `y`. It is very similar to sound `i` in word "still".

* zyna = "fairy"

**Letter `h`:** has two pronunciations depending on it's position in word and previous letter:

* `ɦ` at beginning of words or after a vowel sounds like "h" in "hoard";
* `ə` after a consonant or at the end of words, sounds like `e` in "after";

Since on QUERTY KEYBOARD there is not `ɦ` and no `ə` you can use "h" instead. However it is more correct to use `ɦ` and `ə` if you can. The conversion tool will convert back to these symbols from Maj.

* veha = "vehicle" in this case `h` is `ɦ` like IPA:"veɦa"
* zhi  = "they"    in this case `h` is `ə` like IPA:"zəi"

**Letter `w`:** is called soft `u`. It is pronounced like "w" in "whiskey". You can use `w` before a vowel but not before a consonant. This letter is not closed and not open but tranzitional, aproximand. In some languages this letter is considered consonant.

**interjections:**

Two letter words starting with "w" and one vowel are called interjections. In these words the vowel is a little bit longer than usual but is not duplicated. We do not write: waaa! but wa!

* wa! (administration)
* wo! (surprise)
* wi! (happiness)
* we! (sadness, cry)
* wu! (disapproval)
* wh! (disgusting)

## Consonants

Maj is using 20 consonants:

method   | bilabial| labio dental | alveolar | valar | post alveolar | glottal 
---------|---------|--------------|----------|-------|---------------|----------
plosive  | p,b     |              | t, d     | k, ğ  |               |
nasal    | m       |              | n        |       |               |
trill    |         |              | r        |       |               | 
fricative|         | f,v          | s,z      |       | x, j          | ɦ
lateral  |         |              | l        |       |               |
africate |         |              | c        |       | q, ĝ          |


Most consonants are similar to: Italian and Romanian but are also found in English;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `k`  is voiceless velar stop like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";
* Letter  `ğ`  is voiced velar fricative like `gu` in "guitar";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `v`  is fricative vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `z`  is alveolar-dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "ashes" or "fashion";
* Letter  `j`  is fricative-post alveolar, like `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `c`  is alveolar affricate, like `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `q`  is voiceless postalveolar affricate like "ch" in "church";
* Letter  `ĝ`  is voiced postalveolar affricate like "ge" in "genetic";
* Letter  `ɦ`  is voiced fricative glottal like "h" in "happy";

## Difficult sounds

You should be familiar with most of these sounds if you speak English. However the sounds in Maj are associated differently with the letters. Next you will learn the rules to make Maj sounds.

**Digraphs**

Maj do not have digraphs. Instead we associate letters { c, q, x } with digraphs: {ts, ch and sh}. This will enable creation of shorter words: 

* Letter `c` sounds `t͡s` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* Letter `q` sounds `t͡ʃ` or ʈ͡ʂ like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)
* Letter `x` sounds `ʃ` or `ʂ` like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)

**Examples:** 
Phonetic writing is quoted using IPA: notation 

* qoka => IPA:"t͡ʃoka"  = "chocolate"   
* xava => IPA:"ʃava"    = "shovel"    
* koqa => IPA:"kot͡ʃa"  = "coach"     
* qika => IPA:"t͡ʃika"  = "girl"      
* cita => IPA:"t͡sita"  = "target"    

**Modified: c**

Maj letter "c" sounds like Latvian "c" not English "c". It sounds like `t͡s` in English word "cats". To make this sound you put you tang in "t" position and make a pitch sound "s" instead. Group `ts` is actually never used in Maj.

**IPA practice**
* ceba = ENG: "cerebellum" => IPA: "t͡seba"
* ciga = ENG: "cigarette"  => IPA: "t͡siga"

**Modified: k**

Maj letter "k" is plosive-valear not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in "culture" or "k" in "karate". Notice "k" is a very frequent letter in Maj. 

**examples:**

* akwa = "water";
* qoka = "chocolate";

**Trilled: r**

Letter "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 

**Fricative: j** 

Letter "j" is voiced fricative-post alveolar.  This sound must be produced with the tip of your tongue relaxed on  roof top and softly vibrated. Best IPA symbol for this sound is `ʒ`. 

* ijma	=> IPA:"iʒma" = "picture"
* joka  => IPA:"ʒoka" = "game"

**Modified: g**

Maj is a Romance language therefore it has two pronunciations for letter `g`: 

* hard g = gama ğ, equivalent to script:(ɤ) IPA:"g"
* soft g = gama ĝ, equivalent to script:(ფ) IPA:"d͡ʒ"

Regular QUERTY KEYBOARD do not include a method for cedilla: `ğ` and `ĝ` can not be produced. So you should use "g" to type the words. Maj have deterministic rules to distinguish the two pronunciations. An intelligent editor could make an automatic conversion while typing. If you have a smarter keyboard, it is good to type "g" symbol with cedilla. 

**notes:**

In all Romance languages "g" is problematic. Italian and Romanian is using "ge", "gi" for soft "g". However there are two problems with this: First the other vowels will not produce a soft "g". For example sound `d͡ʒa` or `d͡ʒu` can not be produced. For making the hard "g" follow by "e" or "i" is not possible.

Romanian and Italian is silenced "h" resolve the "g" problem. So there are:  "ghi" and "ghe" tree-graphs that are hard to explain to children. English and Spanish are using alternative silenced "u" to make "gui" and "gue". However this method introduce another problem. 

In old Spanish you must use `ü` (that is u with diaeresis) to make the sound `u` audible instead of silenced. Recent Spanish language reform has eliminated this rule so now you must know how to spell some words. 

**Soft: ĝ = ფ**

Letter "g" followed by vowels {`i`, `e`} becomes soft, post-alveolar affricate similar to `gi` in word "giraffe". This sound must be produced with the middle of your tongue relaxed on roof top of your mouth softly vibrated. Best IPA symbol for this sound is `d͡ʒ`. 

* ĝema = gema	 => IPA:"d͡ʒema" = "money"


**Hard: ğ = ɤ** 

Learn more: [listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_velar_stop)

Letter "g" followed by {`a`,`u`,`o`,`y`,`w`,`h`} or any consonant becomes hard `g` = `ğ`. This sound is produced similar to `k` except it is vibrated. The IPA symbol for hard `g` is actually "g". It sounds similar to `g` in "guitar".

* goxa = ğoxa => IPA: "goʃa" = "left"
* agra = ağra => IPA: "agra" = "farmer"


**Modified: q**

In Maj, "Q" is used to create IPA sound:"t͡ʃ". It sounds like "ch" in "chin" or "chicken" or "peach". This replace digraph "ch", thus making the Maj words shorter. 

Learn more:[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)

* qyka = "girl" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃika";
* qesa = "ceez" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃesa";
* qoka = "chocolate" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃoka";

**Note:** Letter "q" is always followed by a vowel or semivowel and can not be followed by a consonant. In many Romance alphabets this letter is restricted to be followed only by vowel "u" but Maj has extended this convention to make "q" more useful.

**Modified: x**

Letters `x` sounds like: `sh` in `sheep`. To prodice this sound you must softly press the middle of the tongue on the roof top of your mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. In most other Romance languages this sound is "cs" but Maj has repurpose this letter.

* Word: "xi" means "keep it quiet" similar to many Romance languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʃue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written Luxemburg and is read "Luʃemburg" in Maj;

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.

## Clusters

A clusters represents a group of two consonants.

**Rules:**

* same letter can not be used twice in a cluster;
* some combinations can not be pronounced;

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these clusters are usable in Maj words:

```
br bs bj
kl km kn kr ks kt kv kz kx
dl dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lk ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nk nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rk rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
jb jk jd jl jm jn jr js jt jv 
gn gl gm gr gv gs
``` 

## Diphthongs
ɦ,ə

Two vowels combined together into one cluster are called diphthongs.

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u  | y | ə
--|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au |ay | aə
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu |ey | eə
i |ia |ie | . |io |iu |iy | iə
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou |oy | oə
w |wa |we |wi |wo |.  |wy | wə
y |ya |ye |iy |yo |yu | . | yə


**Notes:**

* there is a total of 36 diphthongs in Maj;
* u is replaced by w when is followed by a vowel;
* h is pronounced ə when is following a vowel;  
 
## Weight

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to calculate a _cost_ that represents word complexity. More frequent words should have a lower cost. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words, rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |aeyiou 
  2    |lmnfsx 
  3    |bkcdpt 
  4    |vjrz
  5    |hgqw

**Cost:**  

We can compute the word cost using an algorithm. The lower the cost, the better. By using the same algorithm to other languages, we can evaluate _complexity_. After a quick computation of only 500 samples Maj prove to be about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

## Cost of typing

The cost of typing on keyboard is different than speaking the word:

Cost |  Letter
-----|-------------------------------------------
  1  |asdfjklgh
  2  |qweruiop
  3  |zxcvm 
  4  |tbyn

**penalty:**

There is an extra cost of 2 for one hand letters.

Hand   | Letter
-------|------------------------------------------
left   |asdfgqwertzxcvb
right  |hjklyuiopnm  

## Average cost

For computing an average cost, we consider 3 functions:

* tcos: cost of typing one word on keyboard 
* rcos: cost of reading and speaking with your voice
* wcos: cost of hand writing the word 

We use a priority average function, to evaluate average cost:

```
function cmaj(w as string) as integer
  cost = rcos(w)*3 + tcos(w)*2 + wcos(w) 
  cmaj  = cost/6
end function
```

CMaj function is available for open office macro, and is used in Lexicon:NOV tab to create new words.

## Word divergence:

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
j     | x
q     | c

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then one of the words must be changed or the words must be related. 

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 3
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 1

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
