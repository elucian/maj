# MAJ Alphabet

Maj is a Romance language. So it is using using 26 Lating letters: [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

```
--------------------------------------------------
A   B   K   D   E   F   G   H   Y   J   L   Q   C
a   b   k   d   e   f   g   h   y   j   l   q   c
--------------------------------------------------
M   N   O   P   R   S   X   T   U   I   W   V   Z    
m   n   o   p   r   s   x   t   u   i   w   v   z       
--------------------------------------------------
```

**notes:**

* the order of letters is different from ISO standard;
* for handwriting Maj is using [script](script.md);

## Capitalization

Maj uses both lowercase and uppercase letters from Latin alphabet. 

* Names are written with uppercase letters;
* Nouns are written with first capital letter;
* Other words are written with lowercase letters;

## Pronunciation

Alphabet pronunciation is inspired from [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

-----------------------------------------------------
```

**Notes:**

* Maj has a large range of familiar sounds, easy to produce;
* Maj sounds are produced with your tongue behind your teeth;
* Maj do not use "th" and "sh" digraphs like English do;
* You will never bite yourself or spit around when you speak Maj;

**Reference:**

For pronounciation we have used phonetic symbols: 

* [IPA Org ](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 
* [IPA Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)

**Phonetic:**

Maj is a phonetic language, which means it’s written the way it sounds, and vice versa.

* Maj phonetic:  MAJ:"word";
* IPA phonetic:  IPA:"word";
* English words: ENG:"word";

## Vowels

Maj has 6 vowels: { a e y i o u } unlike Italian that has only 5: 

* Letter `a`  is open central, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `y`  is close front, like first `y` in "yellow";
* Letter `i`  is closed-central like `i` in word "still";
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

## Semi-vowels

Maj has two semi-vowels: {h, w} that have special pronunciation:

**Letter `h`:** has two pronunciations depending on it's position and previous letter:

1. `ɦ` at beginning of words or after a vowel like "h" in "hoard";
2. `ə` after a consonant or end of words like `e` in "after";

**examples:**

* veha = "vehicle" in this case `h` is `ɦ` like IPA:"veɦa"
* zhy  = "they"    in this case `h` is `ə` like IPA:"zəi"

**Letter `w`:** is called soft `u`. It is pronounced like "w" in "whiskey". You can use `w` before a vowel but not before a consonant. You never use "u" before a vowel but you relace "u" with "w". 

**interjections:**

Two letter words starting with "w" and one vowel are called interjections. In these words the vowel is a little bit longer than usual but is not duplicated. We do not write: waaa! but wa!

* wa! (administration)
* wo! (surprise)
* wy! (happiness)
* we! (sadness, cry)
* wu! (disapproval)
* wh! (disgusting)

## Consonants

Maj is using 19 consonants:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z, g
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, q, x
* glottal: h

Most consonants are similar to: Italian and Romanian;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `c`  is fricative, alveolar, like `ts` in "cats" or `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `g`  is hard G plosive-uvular like `g` in "guitar";
* Letter  `j`  is fricative-post alveolar, like `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `q`  is alveoli-palatal like "ch" in words like "charm", "church", "chin";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `z`  is dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";

## Difficult sounds

There are some rules and concepts you must understand for reading and writing Maj letters:

**Digraphs**

Following letters are represented using digraphs in English.

* Letter `c` sounds `ts` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* Letter `q` sounds `tʃ` like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)
* Letter `x` sounds `ʂ`   like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)

**Note:** Phonetic writing is using notation: IPA:

**examples:** 

* qoka = "chocolate" => IPA:"t͡ɕoka"    
* xava = "shovel"    => IPA:"ʂava"    
* koqa = "coach"     => IPA:"kot͡ɕa"  
* qyka = "girl"      => IPA:"t͡ɕika"  
* cita = "target"    => IPA:"t͡sɨta"  

**Modified: C**

Te Letter "c" sounds like Latvian "c" not English "c". It sounds like "ts" in English word "cats". The best IPA sound is: `t͡s` To make this sound you put you tang in "t" position and make a pitch sound "s" instead. 

**IPA practice**
* ceba = ENG: "cerebellum" => IPA: "t͡seba"
* ciga = ENG: "cigarette"  => IPA: "t͡səga"

**Modified: K**

Letter "k" is similar to "g" (plosive-valear) but  is not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in "culture" or "k" in "karate". Notice "k" is a very frequent letter in Maj.

**examples:**

* akwa = "water";
* qoka = "chocolate";

**Trilled R**

Letter "R" and "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 

**Fricative J** 

Letter "j" is usually voiced fricative-post alveolar.  This sound must be produced with the tip of your tongue relaxed on  roof top and softly vibrated. Best IPA symbol for this sound is `ʒ`. 

* yjma	=> IPA:"iʒma" = "picture"
* joka  => IPA:"ʒoka" = "game"

**Affricate J** 

Letter "j" followed by vowels {a, e, y, o, u} is, voiced post-alveolar affricate. This sound must be produced with the midle of your tongue relaxed on roof top and softly vibrated. Best IPA symbol for this sound is `d͡ʒ`. It sounds similar to `gi` in word "giraffe"

* jema	 => IPA:"d͡ʒema" = "money"

**Modified: Q**

In Maj, "Q" is used to create similar sound to Latvian "Č" = IPA:"tʃ". It sounds like "ch" in "chin" or "chicken" or "peach". This replace digraph "ch", thus making the Maj words shorter. 

* qyka = "girl" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃika";
* qesa = "ceez" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃesa";
* qoka = "chocolate" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃoka";

**Modified: X**

Letters `X` and `x` are pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. You can avoid `ş` by using group `ks`.  To prodice "ş" sound you must softly press the middle of your tongue on the roof top of the mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. 

* Word: "xi" means "keep it quiet" similar to many languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʂue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written "Lucsemburg" in Maj to avoid reading "Luʂemburg" that will be incorrect;
* Word "xokh" => Maj: "ʂoklə" = ENG:"chocolate" 

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.

## Clusters

A clusters represents a group of two consonants.

**Rules:**

* same letter can not be used twice in a cluster;
* some combinations can not be pronounced;

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these clusters are usable:

```
br bs bj
kl km kn kr ks kt kv kz kx
dl dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lk ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nk nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rk rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
jb jk jd jl jm jn jr js jt jv 
gn gl gm gr gv gs
``` 

Consonant clusters are expensive. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Diphthongs

Two vowels combined together into one cluster are called diphthongs.

x |a  |e  |y  |o  |u  | i | h 
--|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
a | · |ae |ay |ao |au | · | ·
e |ea | · |ey |eo |eu | · | eh
y |ya |ye | · |yo |yu |yi | yh
o |oa |oe |oy | · |ou | . | oh 
i | . | . |iy | . |iu | . | .
w |wa |we |wy |wo |.  |wi | wh   

**Notes:**

* there is a total of 28 diphthongs in Maj
* u is replaced by w when is followed by a vowel
* diphthong in a word increase its cost with 1 point
 
## Weight

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to calculate a _cost_ that represents word complexity. More frequent words should have a lower cost. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words, rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |aeyiou 
  2    |lmnfsx 
  3    |bcdpth  
  4    |vjrzkg
  5    |qw

**Cost:**  

We can compute the word cost using an algorithm. The lower the cost, the better. By using the same algorithm to other languages, we can evaluate _complexity_. After a quick computation of only 500 samples Maj prove to be about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

## Cost of typing

The cost of typing on keyboard is different than speaking the word:

Cost |  Letter
-----|-------------------------------------------
  1  |asdfjklgh
  2  |qweruiop
  3  |zxcvm 
  4  |tbyn 

**penalty:**

There is an extra cost of 2 for one hand letters.

Hand   | Letter
-------|------------------------------------------
left   |asdfgqwertzxcvb
right  |hjklyuiopnm  

## Average cost

For computing an average cost, we consider 3 functions:

* tcos: cost of typing one word on keyboard 
* rcos: cost of reading and speaking with your voice
* wcos: cost of hand writing the word 

We use a priority average function, to evaluate average cost:

```
function cmaj(w as string) as integer
  cost = rcos(w)*3 + tcos(w)*2 + wcos(w) 
  cmaj  = cost/6
end function
```

CMaj function is available for open office macro, and is used in Lexicon:NOV tab to create new words.

## Word divergence:

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
j     | x
q     | c

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then one of the words must be changed or the words must be related. 

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
