## Maj Phonetic 

Sounds: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)

``` 
----------------------------------
 Maj: î  ă  ş  j  q  ţ  ç   g   
 IPA: ɨ  ə  ʃ  ʒ  ɢ  t͡s t͡ʃ  d͡ʒ 
----------------------------------
```

**Examples:**

If we were to use Maj phonetic we could write some English words like this:

its       :"iţ"
she       :"şe"
generator :"generetăr"
pigeon    :"pigăn"
giraffe   :"giraf"
fusion    :"fujăn"
guitar    :"qitar"
gees      :"qis"
cheese    :"ciz"
accident  :"acsidă" 
chocolate :"coclăt"
peach     :"pici"
speech    :"spici"
initial   :"inişăl"
fashion   :"faşăn"
yacht     :"iat"
français  :"fronse"

**Note:** Maj phonetic is using notation :"...", it is one of Maj punctuation rules.

## Pronunciation

Maj alphabet is enhanced to maximize number of sounds you can make with Latin letters.

* The alphabet is identical and restricted to Latin ISO standard;
* All letters are pronounced the same in all words with some exceptions;
* All letters are voiced except `h` that can be silent sometimes;
* You add a short `â` sound after consonants like "eo" from "pigeon";

```

----------------------------------------------------
```

**notes**

* Maj pronunciation is less important in Maj than other languages;
* Most names from other Romanic languages do not use phonetic translation;
* New York, Chicago or Washington are read correctly in Maj;

## Vowels

The vowels are read like in Italian. Romanian and Spanish not English or German;

* Letter `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like first `i` in `initial`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;
* Letter `y`  is pronounced: `i` or `ă` depending of position;

## Consonants

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Letter  `j`  is trilled, similar to sound `si` in "fusion";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `z`  is trilled similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled similar to `rr` in "Africa";
* Letter  `v`  is trilled like `v` in "vehicle";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or "fashion";
* Letter  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey" but is very rare.

## Modified Letters

{R, J, C, G, W, Q, K, X, Y}

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter of the Maj language. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Trilled J**

Letter "J", "j" is always trilled. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must press the tip of your tongue in the roof top and produce a voiced "sh". The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 

**Whistled C**

Letter "C", "c" is whistled when followed by vowels {`a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`,`y`} or semivowel `h`. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce a vistled "ch". The best symbol for this sound is "t͡ʃ"

**Fricative C**

Letter "C", "c" can be pronounced "k" when followed by consonant. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a fricative "ca". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "c".

**Whistled G**

Letter "G", "g" can be whistled like "gi", "ge" when follow by any vowel. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the front roof and produce a voiced "dge" or "dgi". The best IPA symbol for this sound is /d͡ʒ/.

**Fricative G**

Letter "G", "g" can be pronounced "ɢ" when followed by consonant. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a fricative "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ".

**Fricative Q**

Letter "Q", "q" is pronounced "ɢ" and must be followed by a vowel or semivowel:`h`. To make this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a fricative "gue" or "gui". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ɢ".

* aqua is going to be pronounced: "agua" and not "akua"
* aqui is going to be pronounced: "agui" and not "akui"


**Modified: X**

Letter `X` is pronounced like: `sh` in `sheep`. In some words, letter `x` is replaced by `cs`, to avoid `ş` pronunciation.  To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce whistled "s". The best IPA symbol for this sound is "ʃ"

* Xue is pronounced "şue"
* Luxemburg is pronounced "Luşemburg"


**Modified: Y**

Letter `Y` represents 2 sounds depending on position in the word.

* `y` at the beginning of words is pronounced "i" like in New York, Yes, Yacht;
* `y` can be pronounced `ə` = `ă` like `eo` in "pigeon" or `io` in "fashion";   
* `y` at end of nouns is converted to `e` to make plural noun;

**Modified: K**

Rarely used only to replace `c` before a vowel or to avoid duplicate `c`.

* avpod duplication of "c" in words like `akcidy` instead of `accidy`;
* used before vowels to prevent formation of diphthongs: {`ke`, `ki`, `ko`, `ku`, 'ky'};

**Modified: W**

Letter W is used at beginning of words and rarely used in the middle of the words.

* is pronounced "u" at beginning of words: wisol:"uisol";
* inside of words can modify "e" that will be read "i" like in new:"niu" ;

## Digraphs

Some rare Maj sounds are similar to English digraphs: 

* sound `ts`  is `t͡s` like `ts`  in "cats";
* sound `ce`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "chase"; 
* sound `ci`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "peach";
* sound `ch`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "chocolate";
* sound `sh`  is `ʃ`   like `sh`  in "fashion";
* sound `ge`  is `d͡ʒ` like `ge`  in "Georgia";
* sound `gi`  is `d͡ʒ` like `gi`  in "Georgia";

**Notes:** 

* Digraphs are considered expensive in Maj!
* G and C can make digraph with any vowel!

## Silent `h`

Sometimes letter `h` is silent, some other times is voiced:

* Letter `h` is always voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is voiced when is following or preceding a vowel;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following after a consonant;

**Notes** 

* Letter `h` can be used after `c` to make sound `t͡ʃ` like in word: `peach`.
* Letter `h` can be used after `s` to make sound `ʃ` like in word: `she`.

In Romanian, `h` is used to prevent digraph formation in groups "che", "chi", "ghe", "ghi", this convention can not be used in Maj since it enters in conflict with English convention for digraph "ch" which is more popular. 

**Romanian:**

* `qe` = `ghe` like: "Gheorghe"
* `qi` = `ghi` like: "Gindă"
* `ke` = `che` like: "cheltuială"
* `ki` = `chi` like: "chitară"

## Two consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 4 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated in maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz 
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft fj
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

Combination of 2 consonants is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "2".

## Two vowels

* Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
* Two semivowel: { w y } 

**diphthongs**

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 

Combination of 2 vowels is expensive in a word. Therefore the total cost receive a penalty of "1".

## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals,
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong,
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```python

# syllable structure
rime     ::= initial + nucleus +(coda)
initial  ::=  C 
nucleus  ::=  V | VV | CV
coda     ::=  C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* be a single vowel at beginning of words
* start with one consonant otherwise
* have a nucleus formed by one or two vowels 
* have a coda formed with one or two consonants
* not all syllables have coda

A syllable can not ...;

* contain `h` after a consonant,
* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 3 letters.
 
## Word formation

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vowels can be used at beginning of words: { y w }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words
4. Two words that have more then one syllable must sound different

**weight:**

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Cost for word complexity. So less expensive words can be learned faster and should be more frequent. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words that are more rarely used.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u, y
  2    |l, m, n, f, s, h
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, g  
  4    |v, j, r, z, k, x
  5    |q, w

**cost:**  

Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce cost. The better the cost, the better the language is and more easy to use. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages, to analyze a language complexity and compare other languages with Maj.

**Sound alike:**

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
a     | y
e     | i
j     | x

The sound alike function is not yet created.

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 5
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 2

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
