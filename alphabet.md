# MAJ Alphabet

Maj alphabet has 28 letters. For each letter letter there is an unique name so we have 26 named letters. Letter g and letter h have two distinct pronounciation but only one name for each.

**notes:**
* the order of letters is different from ISO standard;
* letter name start with the letter it represents;
* each letter represent one sound except `g` and `h`;
* for handwriting see details on: [script](script.md) page;

## Pronunciation

Alphabet pronunciation is inspired from [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

**Notes:**

* Maj has a large range of sounds, easy to produce by humans;
* Maj sounds are produced with your tongue behind your teeth;
* You will never bite yourself or spit around when you speak Maj;
* Maj has deterministic phonetic rules, no need to spell words;

**Tools:**

Maj has some tools for beginners to learn how to read correctly:

* Maj IPA: [phonetic](https://lingojam.com/MajIPA)
* Maj Script: [convertor](https://lingojam.com/MajScript)

**Reference:**

For pronunciation we have used phonetic symbols: 

* [IPA Org ](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/) 
* [IPA Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart)

**Phonetic:**

Phonetic notation has language prefix and is enclosed in double quotes like this:

* Maj phonetic: MAJ:"word";
* IPA phonetic: IPA:"word";
* English phonetic: ENG:"word";
* Franch phonetic: FRA:"word";

## Vowels

Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } sounding like Italian: 

* Letter `a`  is open central, like `a` in `car`;
* Letter `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in `melon`;
* Letter `i`  is close front, like `ee` in `geese`;
* Letter `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Letter `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

## Semi-vowels

Maj has three semi-vowels: {y, h, w} that have special pronunciation:

**Letter `y`:** Is close front, rounded vowel. [listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel) This sound is similar to `i` in word "still". Ipa symbol for this sound is actually "y". 

* zyna = "fairy"

**Letter `h`:** has two pronunciations depending on it's position and previous letter:

* `ɦ` at beginning of words or after a vowel sounds like "h" in "hoard";
* `ə` after a consonant or end of words, sounds like `e` in "after";

**examples:**

* veha = "vehicle" in this case `h` is `ɦ` like IPA:"veɦa"
* zhi  = "they"    in this case `h` is `ə` like IPA:"zəi"

**Letter `w`:** is called soft `u`. It is pronounced like "w" in "whiskey". You can use `w` before a vowel but not before a consonant. You never use "u" before a vowel but you replace "u" with "w". 

**interjections:**

Two letter words starting with "w" and one vowel are called interjections. In these words the vowel is a little bit longer than usual but is not duplicated. We do not write: waaa! but wa!

* wa! (administration)
* wo! (surprise)
* wi! (happiness)
* we! (sadness, cry)
* wu! (disapproval)
* wh! (disgusting)

## Consonants

Maj is using 21 consonants:

* plosive  :  b, d, p, t, k 
* nasal    :  m, n
* trilled  :  r, j, v, z, ğ, ĝ
* labial   :  l, r
* fricative:  f, s, c, q, x
* glottal  :  h

Most consonants are similar to: Italian and Romanian;

* Letter  `b`  is voiced, plosive, bilabial like `b` in "boss";
* Letter  `c`  is fricative, alveolar, like `ts` in "cats" or `zz` in "pizza";
* Letter  `d`  is voiced, plosive, alveolar like `d` in "door";
* Letter  `f`  is fricative, plosive, bilabial like `f` in "frog";
* Letter  `j`  is fricative-post alveolar, like `j` in "jell", "jet";
* Letter  `l`  is liquid, alveolar, like `l` in "lord";
* Letter  `q`  is alveoli-palatal like "ch" in words like "charm", "church";
* Letter  `m`  is nasal, bilabial, like `m` in "mule";
* Letter  `n`  is alveolar, nasal, like `n` in "novel";
* Letter  `p`  is voiceless, plosive, bilabial like `p` in "pin";
* Letter  `r`  is trilled, similar to sound `r` in "rocket"
* Letter  `t`  is voiceless, plosive, alveolar like `t` in "test";
* Letter  `v`  is vibrated, similar to `v` in "voice";
* Letter  `z`  is dental, vibrated, similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Letter  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Letter  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "ashes" or "fashion";
* Letter  `k`  is plosive velar like "k" in "kitten" or "c" in "color";

**Note:** Letters  `g` have two distinct pronounciations: `ğ`and `ĝ` that will be explained below.

## Difficult sounds

There are some concepts you must understand for reading and writing Maj correctly:

**Digraphs**

Following letters are represented using digraphs in English but not in Maj.

* Letter `c` sounds `t͡s` like `ts` in  "cats": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)
* Letter `q` sounds `t͡ʃ` like `ch` in  "peach": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)
* Letter `x` sounds `ʂ`   like `sh` in  "fashion": 
[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)

**Note:** Phonetic writing is quoted using IPA: notation. 

**examples:** 

* qoka => IPA:"t͡ʃoka"  = "chocolate"   
* xava => IPA:"ʃava"    = "shovel"    
* koqa => IPA:"kot͡ʃa"  = "coach"     
* qika => IPA:"t͡ʃika"  = "girl"      
* cita => IPA:"t͡sita"  = "target"    

**Modified: c**

Maj letter "c" sounds like Latvian "c" not English "c". It sounds like "ts" in English word "cats". The best IPA sound is: `t͡s` To make this sound you put you tang in "t" position and make a pitch sound "s" instead. 

**IPA practice**
* ceba = ENG: "cerebellum" => IPA: "t͡seba"
* ciga = ENG: "cigarette"  => IPA: "t͡səga"

**Modified: k**

Maj letter "k" is plosive-valear not trilled. It may be pronounced like "c" in "culture" or "k" in "karate". Notice "k" is a very frequent letter in Maj.

**examples:**

* akwa = "water";
* qoka = "chocolate";

**Trilled: r**

Letter "r" is trill-alveolar in Maj. It is strong like double "rr" in English. To produce this sound, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of tongue taps the roof of the mouth several times. 

**Fricative: j** 

Letter "j" is voiced fricative-post alveolar.  This sound must be produced with the tip of your tongue relaxed on  roof top and softly vibrated. Best IPA symbol for this sound is `ʒ`. 

* ijma	=> IPA:"iʒma" = "picture"
* joka  => IPA:"ʒoka" = "game"

**Modified: g**

Maj letter `g` has two versions: 

* hard g = ğ
* soft g = ĝ

In most Romance languages "g" is problematic. Italian and Romanian is using "ge", "gi" for soft "g". However there are two problems with this: First the other vowels will not produce a soft "g". For example sound `d͡ʒa` can not be produced conveniently. Avoinding soft "g" is expensive. You must use groups "ghi" and "ghe" to resolve this problem.

English and Spanish is using silenced "u" to make "gui" and "gue". However this introduce another problem. In old Spanish you must use u qirh diaeresis `ü` to make sound `u` audible. After Spanish reform you must know the word to pronounce it correctly. 

Maj has a similar problem, resolved by using cedila for print alphabet and by making two letters in scripting alphabet: {ĝ = ფ, ğ = ɤ} 

**Soft: g = ĝ** 

[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate)

Letter "g" followed by vowels {`i`, `e`} becomes soft, post-alveolar affricate similar to `gi` in word "giraffe". This sound must be produced with the middle of your tongue relaxed on roof top of your mouth softly vibrated. Best IPA symbol for this sound is `d͡ʒ`. 

* ĝema = gema	 => IPA:"d͡ʒema" = "money"

Maj script is using letter `ფ` for `ĝ` and soft `g`.

**Hard: g = ğ** 

[listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_velar_stop)

Letter "g" followed by vowels {`a`,`u`,`o`, `y`, `w`, `h`} or any consonant becomes hard `g` = `ğ`. This sound is produced similar to `k` except it is vibrated. The IPA symbol for hard `g` is actually "g". It sounds similar to `g` in "guitar".

* goxa = ğoxa => IPA: "goʂa" = "left"
* agra = ağra => IPA: "agra" = "farmer"

Maj script is using letter `ɤ` for hard `g`.

**Modified: q**

In Maj, "Q" is used to create similar sound to Latvian "Č" = IPA:"tʃ". It sounds like "ch" in "chin" or "chicken" or "peach". This replace digraph "ch", thus making the Maj words shorter. 

* qyka = "girl" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃika";
* qesa = "ceez" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃesa";
* qoka = "chocolate" is read like IPA: "t͡ʃoka";

**Note:** Letter "q" is always followed by a vowel or semivowel and can not be followed by a consonant. In many Romance alphabets this letter is restricted to be followed only by vowel "u" but Maj has modified this letter to make it more useful.

**Modified: x**

Letters `x` is like: `sh` in `sheep`. To prodice this sound you must softly press the middle of the tongue on the roof top of your mouth and produce a fricative whispering sound. 

* Word: "xi" means "keep it quiet" similar to many Romance languages;
* Xue is pronounced "ʃue" and represent a Chinese name; 
* Luxembourg is written Luxemburg and is read "Luʃemburg" in Maj;

If you don't know, Luxembourg has became an independent town and state in 1867.

## Clusters

A clusters represents a group of two consonants.

**Rules:**

* same letter can not be used twice in a cluster;
* some combinations can not be pronounced;

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these clusters are usable:

```
br bs bj
kl km kn kr ks kt kv kz kx
dl dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
fl fr ft fj
lb lk ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
nb nk nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
mf mn mp ms mz mx
pl pr ps pt px 
rb rk rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz rx
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
jb jk jd jl jm jn jr js jt jv 
gn gl gm gr gv gs
``` 

## Diphthongs

Two vowels combined together into one cluster are called diphthongs.

x |a  |e  |y  |o  |u  | i | h 
--|---|---|---|---|---|---|----
a | · |ae |ay |ao |au | · | ·
e |ea | · |ey |eo |eu | · | eh
y |ya |ye | · |yo |yu |yi | yh
o |oa |oe |oy | · |ou | . | oh 
i | . | . |iy | . |iu | . | .
w |wa |we |wy |wo |.  |wi | wh   

**Notes:**

* there is a total of 28 diphthongs in Maj
* u is replaced by w when is followed by a vowel
 
## Weight

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This is call _weight_ and can be used to calculate a _cost_ that represents word complexity. More frequent words should have a lower cost. Gradualy one can assimilate more complex words, rarely used.

Weight |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |aeyiou 
  2    |lmnfsx 
  3    |bkcdpt 
  4    |vjrz
  5    |hgqw

**Cost:**  

We can compute the word cost using an algorithm. The lower the cost, the better. By using the same algorithm to other languages, we can evaluate _complexity_. After a quick computation of only 500 samples Maj prove to be about 50% more efficient than other Romance languages.

## Cost of typing

The cost of typing on keyboard is different than speaking the word:

Cost |  Letter
-----|-------------------------------------------
  1  |asdfjklgh
  2  |qweruiop
  3  |zxcvm 
  4  |tbyn

**penalty:**

There is an extra cost of 2 for one hand letters.

Hand   | Letter
-------|------------------------------------------
left   |asdfgqwertzxcvb
right  |hjklyuiopnm  

## Average cost

For computing an average cost, we consider 3 functions:

* tcos: cost of typing one word on keyboard 
* rcos: cost of reading and speaking with your voice
* wcos: cost of hand writing the word 

We use a priority average function, to evaluate average cost:

```
function cmaj(w as string) as integer
  cost = rcos(w)*3 + tcos(w)*2 + wcos(w) 
  cmaj  = cost/6
end function
```

CMaj function is available for open office macro, and is used in Lexicon:NOV tab to create new words.

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Word divergence:

Some people may pronounce letters in the wrong way. Therefore word composition must consider to replace these letters to make the language lighter. When two words have these letters in same position one other letter must be different, otherwise the words are in conflict, one must be modified.

light | heavy
------|----------
b     | v
l     | r
j     | x
q     | c

Other considerations when making words is the coda. If a word is different from another word only by coda, and this is a vowel then one of the words must be changed or the words must be related. 

## Algorithm

We use this algorithm to compute cost of words:

* for double consonants we add extra cost of 3
* for double vowel we add extra cost of 1

[macro.bas](tools/macro.bas)

## Total cost

Using this algorithm total cost for current: 542 word dictionary

* 4085  in Maj 
* 7231  in English 
* 7642  in Spanish
* 8793  in Franch
* 7696  in Romanian
* 9423  in German
