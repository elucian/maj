# Alphabet

Maj is using: [ISO Basic Latin Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)

**uppercase**
```
A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M
N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   X   Y   Z   W
```

**lowercase**
```
a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   j   K   l   m
n   o   p   q   r   s   t   u   v   x   y   z   w
```

**Notes**

There are 26 letters in Maj alphabet.

Reading the alphabet is different from other Romantic Languages:

* In English alphabet you add an open sound "e" after consonants, but in Maj `ɨ`;
* In Maj you add a short `ɨ` sound after consonants like "eo" from "pigeon";
* The above rule is active only when a consonant letter is standing alone;

**Vowels**

The vowels are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Sound  `a`  is open central vowel, like `a` in "car";
* Sound  `e`  is close-mid front, like `e`  in "melon";
* Sound  `i`  is close front, like first `i` in "initial";
* Sound  `o`  is close-mid back, like `o` in `document`;
* Sound  `u`  is close back, like `oo` in `soon`;

**Other sounds**

Most consonants are read like in Latin ISO alphabet, Italian. Romanian and Spanish;

* Sound  `y`  is close central like `io` in "fashion";
* Sound  `j`  is trilled, similar to sound `si` in "fusion";
* Sound  `s`  is fricative alveolar like `s` in "snake";
* Sound  `z`  is trilled similar to `z` in "zoo";
* Sound  `r`  is trilled similar to `rr` in "Africa";
* Sound  `v`  is trilled like `v` in "vehicle";
* Sound  `g`  is plosive uvular like `g` in "gees", "guitar", "get";
* Sound  `k`  is fricative `c` like `k` in "sky";
* Sound  `x`  is fricative post-alveolar like `sh` in "she" or `sh` in "fashion";
* Sound  `w`  is voiced labial-velar like `w in "whiskey".

**Notation**

I have try to use: [IPA](http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)
notation to represent special Maj sounds.

**Trilled R**

R is a difficult letter of the Maj language. It is like double "rr" in English. To make the trilled R, your tongue is relaxed and the tip of the tongue taps the roof of the mouth once or several times.

**Trilled J**

Letter "J", "j" is trilled. That means your tongue will vibrate. To pronounce this sound you must press the tip of your tongue in the roof top and produce a voiced "sh". The best symbol for this sound is "ʒ". 

**Whistled C**

Letter "C", "c" is whistled when followed by one of {`e`,`i`,`h`}. To pronounce this sound you must press the middle of your tongue on the roof top and produce a fricative "ch". The best symbol for this sound is "t͡ʃ"

**Fricative Q**

Letter "Q", "q" is pronounced "ɢ" when used in middle of words. To pronounce this sound you must press the back of your tongue on the back roof and produce a fricative voiced "gu". The best symbol for this sound is "ɢ"


## Digraphs

Some sounds are created using two letters creating a new sounds. 

maj| romanian | phonetic(*)  
---|----------|--------------
iy | â,  î    | i͡ɨ
ts | ţ        | t͡s
ce | ce       | t͡ʃe
ci | ci       | t͡ʃi
ge | ge       | d͡ʒe
gi | gi       | d͡ʒi
   
**description:**

* sound `ts`  is `t͡s` like `t's` in "cats";
* sound `iy`  is `i͡ɨ` like `eo`  in "pigeon";
* sound `ce`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "chase"; 
* sound `ci`  is `t͡ʃ` like `ch`  in "peach";
* sound `sh`  is `ʃ`   like `sh`  in "fashion";
* sound `ge`  is `d͡ʒ` like `ge`  in "Georgia";
* sound `gi`  is `d͡ʒ` like `gi`  in "Georgia";

## Letter `h`

* Letter `h` is always voiced at beginning of words;
* Letter `h` is voiced when is following pr preceding a vowel;
* Letter `h` is not voiced when is following a consonant;
* Letter `h` is used to prevent digraph formation in groups "che", "chi", "ghe", "ghi";


Though elegant and useful in other Languages, Maj do not use cedilla:

* { î â ă ö ü é è ç ş ţ ...}

**notes**

* Maj accept names from other languages without phonetic translation:  
* New York, Chicago or Washington are acceptable names in Maj.
* France is accepted but "française" should be translated to "franchez"

## Modified Letters

{W, Q, K, X, Y}

**W**
* can be present only at beginning of words: for example: "whiskey".
* inside or at end of words we always use "u" not "w".

**Q** 

Q is not present in following alphabets:

* Cornish, Estonian, Icelandic, 
* Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
* Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Scottish Gaelic, 
* Slovenian, Turkish, or Welsh. 

Maj has a special use for Q:

* At beginning of words `Q` is similar pronounced like `qu` in Latin alphabet,
* In the middle of the words is pronounced "ɢ" like "g" in "rogue",
* After `q` you can use {`e`,`i`} to prevent formation of diphthongs "ge", "gi".

For example: "aqua" is going to be pronounced: "agua"

**X**
* In Maj, X is pronounced like Chinese: `ʃ` and is replacement for `sh` in long words;
* The romantic X is converted into `cs` when is the case, to avoid `ʃ` pronunciation;

**Y**
* `y` at the beginning of words is pronounced "Y" like in New York, yes, yacht;
* `y` after vowel {'i'} is pronounced `ɨ` like ` in "pigeon";
* `y` after vowel {'a', 'e','o','u'} or consonant is pronounced `ə` like `a`  in "chocolate";


**K**
* `k` is used to avoid supplicate group `cc`, it is replaced by `kc`;
* `k` is used before vowels to prevent formation of diphthongs: {`ce`, `ci`};

**Examples**

If we were to use Maj alphabet we could write English words like this:

she       => xe
generator => generetyr
pigeon    => pidjyn
giraffe   => dgiraf
fusion    => fujyn
guitar    => qitar
gees      => qis
cheese    => ciz
accident  => akcidynt 
chocolate => ceoclyt
peach     => pici
speech    => spici
initial   => inixyl  
fashion   => faxyn
yacht     => yaht

## Consonants

Not all consonants are equal. Maj is dividing consonants in 4 categories:

* plosive :  b, d, p, t, g, k 
* nasal   :  m, n
* trilled :  r, j, v, z
* labial  :  l, r
* fricative: f, s, c, h, q, x

**combinations**

* a single letter is never duplicated in maj,
* combinations that can not be pronounced are not used

**Examples**

After a short analysis, these CC combinations are usable:

```
br bs 
cl cm cn cr cs ct cv cz 
dl dj dm dr dv gr tl tm tr 
pl pr ps pt  
mf mn mp ms mz
nb nc nd nf ng nh nj nl nm nq ns nt nv nz
lb lc ld lf lg lj lm ln lp lq ls lt lv lz
rb rc rd rf rg rh rl rm rn rq rp rs rt rz
fl fr ft fj
sc sf sl sm sn sp sr st sv 
vr zb zd zg zm zn zv
``` 

## Vowels

Maj has 5 vowels: { a e i o u } 
Two semivowel: { w y } 

## Diphthong

Two vowels combined together into one are called diphthongs

**Approved:**

x |a  |e  |i  |o  |u | y 
--|---|---|---|---|--|--
a | · |ae |ai |ao |au| ·
e |ea | · |ei |eo |eu|ey  
i |ia |ie | · |io |iu|iy
o |oa |oe |oi | · |ou| .
u |ua |ue |ui |uo | ·|uy 


## Syllable

A combination of vowels and consonants are called syllable. 

**structure:**	

To describe the structure of a syllable we use following convention:

* In parenthesis (), I have put the optionals,
* I have used: V = Vowel, C = Constant, D = Diphtong,
* Alternatives are separated with vertical bar: "\|",
* I use + to suggest concatenation of two parts,

```python
# syllable structure
syllable ::= onset   + rhyme
onset    ::= initial +(medial)
rime     ::= nucleus +(coda)

# onset components
initial  ::= V | W | C
medial   ::= {h s} present in digraphs

# rime is the last part
nucleus + coda
nucleus  ::= V | CV
coda     ::= C | CC
```

**Description:**

A syllable can ...:

* can be a single vowel only at beginning of words
* can start with one consonant 
* can have a nucleus formed from one or two vowels
* can have a coda formed with one or two consonants

A syllable can not ...;

* contain `h` after a consonant, except (c, g)
* contain more then 2 consonants,
* contain more then 4 letters.
 
## Word composition

1. Open vowels can be used as syllable at beginning of words: { a e i o u }
2. Diphtongs, starting with semi-vowels can be used at beginning of words: { y w }
3. Syllable that have "coda" present are used only for end of words,
4. Composite words using two words must be separated by apostrophe: `'`

# Complexity

Letters and sounds are more or less expensive to make. This can be used to give a Cost for word complexity. So less expensive words can be learned faster. Gradualy one can assimilate more more complex words.

Cost   |Sounds
-------|----------------------------------------
  1    |a, e, i, o, u
  2    |l, m, n, h, y 
  3    |b, c, d, p, t, f, s, q 
  4    |v, j, g, k, x, z, r, w 

**calculation**  
Words with higher cost will be analyzed to reduce total cost of the language. The better the cost, the better the language is and more easy to understand. We can generalize this algorithm for other languages not only for Maj.
