In this document we describe the basics of MAJ semantic.

* How to say greetings
* Pronouns and cases
* Verb tense
* Noun article
* Some prepositions

## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------
ciao  |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao
salu  |health    | salud      | la santé   | salutem   | sănătate    | salute
adio  |farewell  | adiós      | à bientôt  | adios     | adio        | addio

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* salu = bless you  (verb: when somebody is sneezing)
* muna = world      (from latin: mundo)
* luna = moon       (just in case you may be confused)

**examples:**

* ciao muna = hello world
* adio todo = farewell all
* salu todo = health for all


## Words

A word have a role in a sentence. Maj unlike most other languages is using a special syntax rule to differentiate word category by _coda_. The coda is the last letter of the word. In other languages the words are not differentiated in any way, therefore the same exact word can have multiple meanings. But not in Maj. If the meaning is different then we must change the coda or make another word for it.


**notes:**
1. A word in general start with a consonant or a vowel but should end with a vowel. This rule makes words easy to connect together in a phrase using prepositions and articles.
2. A word has a _root_ and _coda_. Root is invariable, but changing the _coda_ will change the meaning of the word. The word meaning must be related somehow. If a word does not have a related meaning, it will be a funny mistake to use it.
3. Words having root with coda can not exist without a coda. You can add a suffix to a word but a root word without the coda can means something different, a shorter word maybe totally unrelated to the word with coda.

* qara   = square (shape)
* qar'ma = square brackets [] (symbol)
* pos    = behind
* poso   = own/posses

**coda:**

* Nouns are finalized with {"a", "e"};
* Verbs are finalized with {"u"} or suffix: { so, fu, pa};
* Adjectives and Adverbs are finalized with {o, y};
* Prepositions are also 1, 2 or 3 letter long and usually finalized with vowel;

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Maj pronoun is regular and have the following features:

**Features:**

* pronouns do not have gender (Maj is gender-less)
* it has 3 persons (I, II, III)
* it has 3 cases: nominative, objective, possessive
* it has 2 numeral forms: singular and plural
* it combine with the article to form the cases.

**Nominative**

Is the person or the thing who perform the action.

  ps |singular          | plural
-----|------------------|-----------------------------
  1  | yo = I           | nu  = we
  2  | tu = you         | vu  = y'all
  3  | su = he, she, it | zu  = they

**Objective**

 1  | la ma = to me          | la na = to us   
 2  | la ta = to you         | la va = to y'all
 3  | la sa = to him/her/it  | la za = to them 
 
**note:* 
 * it is a total of 6+1 = 7 pronoun words

 al'ta = your           | al'va = yours
 al'sa = his, hers, its | al'za = theirs

**Reflexive**

To make reflexive we use coda "syfo" = "self"

* ma syfo = myself;
* tu syfo = yourself; 
* su syfo = himself/ itself
* nu syfo = ourselves; 
* vu syfo = yourselves; 
* zu syfo = themselves; 

**Sort adverbs**

This is used as an augment for verb to create a new meaning.

ha = let's

* nu haru bosu sa = we have search him
* nu dovu bosu sa = we must search him

## Verbs

tesa = time

--------|-----------|----------------------------
ya      | yasa      | present (go now)
fu      | fusa      | future
pa      | pasa      | past

**undefined time**

verb: joku = to play

* yo joku  = I play
* tu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = he  play

**time suffix**

## Proposition

Structure of proposition: Subject + verb'time + objective + adverb.

verb: vidu  = to see

* su vidu'pa va ny'foa!  = He have never seen y'all!
* tu vidu'fu ma suv!     = You will see me often!

## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
ke      | what?    | qué     | ce
ky      | who?     | quien   | cine
ku      | how?     | como    | cum
ko      | which?   | cual    | care
ka      | no?      | non     | nu?

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

maj        |New  | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
-----------|-----|----------|---------|---------------
de ke tesa?|uta  | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
de ke loka?|ubi  | where?   | donde   | about what location?
de ke reza?|ura  | why?     | por qué | for what reason?

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke magu'fu tu  ?  = what are you going to eat ?
* ky seru'pa der ?  = who was there?
* ku seru'so tu  ?  = how are you ?   
* ka magu'fu tu  ?  = you have not eaten ?

Asking about location can be explicit using que:

* de ke loka ti andu ? = where are you going?
* de ke loka ti venu ? = where are you coming from?
* de ke loka ti seru ? = where are you from?
    
You can ask about location isomg `ubi` or time isomg `cud`:

* es la loka ke tu joku? = is the place you play?
* es la tesa ke zu venu? = is the time they come?

**expressions**
  
You can use `von ubi`, or `tsu ubi` instead of `loka`.
  
* von ubi tsu ubi? = from where to where!

Possible answers:

* von hir tsu ybi! = from here to there!
* von loka ke tu picu!  = from a place you like!
* von tesa ke lo oviu!  = from a forgotten time!

verb: oveu = to forget

## Responses

The interogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

**familiar**

* sy / asi = ye / yes
* ka / kan = no /  not


**polite**

* cero = indeed
* juso = right
* fawo = wrong

**logical**

* vero!  = true, affirmative
* faso!  = false, negative, 
* kaxo!  = unknown

**scientific**
For stronger assurance answer you can specify the logical values:

* bono! = good, tasteful
* malo! = bad, repulsive

**composite**

* kan-juso = incorrect, not justified
* tum-juso = to be justified

## Noun

Noun is a word terminated with coda:

* coda "a" = generic singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pana  = bread
* pane  = breads

[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

In Maj, article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

* la  = the (singular)
* le  = the (plural)

**example**

* la pana = the bread
* le pene = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

es = it is (seru) = to be

Singular   |  Plural
-----------|--------------
eso = this |  ese = these 
elo = that |  ele = those


**example:**

* eso pana = this bred
* ese pane = these breads

3. Descriptive article _descriptive form:_

* de    = of 
* de la = of the

**example:**

* English: the freckles on my face
* Spanish: las pecas en mi cara
* Maj: le pece de mia cara

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* una Mergedes fon la gupa de auto = a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* oru = any
* omy = every
* aly = all
* mot = many
* pau = few
* van = several
* som = some 
* yxo = approximative

Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

* una mela = one apple
* dua mele = two apples
* omy mela = every apple
* oru mela = any apple
* som mele = some apples
* aly mele = all apples
* mot mele = many apples
* yxo diz male = approximative 10 apples

Invariant noun is terminated in "s" or other consonant:

* pau Mercedes = few Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes
