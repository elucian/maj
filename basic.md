**symbols**

When used in text some symbols are read out loud:

* symbol `+` is read et
* symbol `/` is read or
* symbol `:` is read con (used for pair-up or time)

## Nouns

In Maj nouns are words representing objects, persons or places.  Nouns have a root form that is invariant and a coda that can change. Most nouns are ending with `a` that can change into `e`. When a noun is enind with `e` it represents plural.  

** examples

* pana   = bread
* pane   = breads
* bana   = banana
* bane   = bananas
* aqua   = the water
* huga   = the juice  

## Article prepositions

An article is a word used to modify a noun, which is a person, place, object, or idea. Technically, an article is an adjective, which is any word that modifies a noun. Usually adjectives modify nouns through description, but articles are used instead to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 

There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite Article**

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those


Let's begin by looking at the definite article. This article is the word 'the,' and it refers directly to a specific noun or groups of nouns. For example:

* the freckles on my face
* the alligator in the pond
* the breakfast burrito on my plate

Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific.

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj, indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* uno Mercedes = a Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 

Other numeral articles:

oru = any
omi = every
ale = all
mot = many
poc = few
van = several
som = some 
non = none


**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)

**patterns** 

* ita  pana    = the bread
* ite  pana    = these breads
* ita  aqua    = the water
* ita  bana    = the banana
* ite  bana    = these bananas
* ita  huga    = the juice  
  
* ite  cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* ita  hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* ite  cheola  = the chocolate drops with alcohol
* ita  hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol 

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Pronouns have 3 cases in Maj:

* nominative
* objective
* possessive

**Nominative**

Is the person who perform the action.

  p  |singular       | plural
-----|---------------|-----------------------------
  1  | je = I        | nu = we
  2  | te = you      | vu = you
  3  | hi = he       | zu = they
  3  | xi = she      | 
  3  | li = it       | 


**Objective**

Is the person who receive the action.

  p | singular  | plural
----|-----------|-----------------------------
 1  | my  = me  | ny = us
 2  | ty  = you | vy = you all
 3  | hy  = he  | zy = them
 3  | xy  = her | 
 3  | ly  = it  | 

**Possessive**

Is a composite word for a person or object who own something or have something.

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
meo = mine  | nuo = ours
teo = yours | vuo = yours
hio = his   | zuo = theirs
xio = hers  | xuo = theirs
lio = its   | luo = theirs

## Verbs & conjugation

The verbs have a root of 4 - 5 character long and is terminated with `u`. Verbs are more often used than nouns, and are therefore more valuable so we reduce the number of characters from 6 to 4. There are plenty of possible combinations that do not sound so bad if we put some work into it.

**rules:**

1. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. The verb is used in conjunction with a nominative subject and an objective subject. If the subject is not near verb, it can be replaced by a pronoun.

2. The verb do not change its root with the case or number. However, a verb root can change `u` in `a` or `e` to becomes a noun. If "u" is changed to "o" it becomes adjective. 

**Some popular verbs:**

 Maj     |Spanish      | English
---------|-------------|---------------

 sanu    |             | to get healthy

## Time prepositions

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "'" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced as a single word


**nouns:**

* tepa  = time
* futa  = future
* resa  = present  
* pasa  = past

**examples:**

* nara de futa = story from future
* dica de pasa = talk about the past

**sufix:**

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
ure     | present (in general now)
ugo     | present (continuum present)
ufu     | sometime in the future
upa     | sometime in the past

**time prepositions**

* foa   = sometime 
* nuc   = never (Spanish nunca
* suv   = often (French souvent)
* mox   = soon  (Latin mox)
* nau   = now   (English)

**examples**

vidu  = to see

* te vid'ufu suv ita my!  = you will see me often!
* te vid'ure foa ita my!  = you can see me sometime!
* je vid'upa nuc ita ty!  = I have never seen you before!
* je vid'ugo nau ita vy!  = I see you all now!

Structure of above propositions: Subject + verb'time + adverb + article + pronoun.

**notes:**

* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that was singular but is no longer used.
* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural, so y'all is redundant.

**singular conjugation**

jocu = to play

* hi joc'ure = he is playing right now
* hi joc'ufu = he will play in the future 
* hi joc'upa = he play some time ago

**plural conjugation**
* nu jocu foa  = we play sometime
* vu jocu nuc  = you never play
* zu jocu suv  = they play often

## Verb transformation

Basic for of Wee verb into an attribute using suffix 'uxo

**to adjective:**

jocu => joc'uxo = playful

**So far:**
* je ser joc'uxo = I'm playful
* te ser joc'uxo = you are playful 
* hi ser joc'uxo = he is playful

**to noun:**

Use termination 'era to make a noun.

* je ser'upa una joc'era = I was a player
* nu ser'ufu joc'era     = we will be players
