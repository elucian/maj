## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     |  Romanian   
------|----------|------------|------------|-------------
qaw   |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | ceau, salut       
bai   |farewell  | adiós      | à bientôt  | la revedere       

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* muda = world      
* jedo = everyone

**examples:**

* qaw muda = hello world
* bai jedo = goodbye everyone

## Words

A word is a rapid succession of sounds without pause. Maj have two kind of words: basic words and composite words. Words are used together in propositions. One word have a single role in a sentance. If the word role must be different a word can sligtly change its form by adding a suffix, a prefix or changing its coda.


**notes:**
1. Particles are words of 2 character long. Particles are used to create interjections, pronouns, numerals, prefixes, suffixes and prepositions. These words can have form: VC, or CV In total there are will be about 80 words of this kind.
2. Short words having 3 character long are using pattern: VCV or CVV. These words are in general prepositions, adverbs or adjectives. There will be about 150 short words of this kind.
3. Basic words are 4 character long. A basic word is using these 4 patterns: CVCV, VCVV, VCCV, VCVC. This rule makes words easy to connect together in propositions using articles. There will be about 2020 words of this kind.
2. Basic word has a _root_ and a _coda_. The root is invariable, but changing the _coda_ will slightly change the meaning of the word. Usually the words having same root are related. Basic words are regular.
4. Words can end with a consonant. Last consonant is called a _stop consonant_. Usually these words represent prepositions, numerals or nouns that have no plural. Materials, fluids and names are ending with a consonant. These words are having invariable form.
5. Composite words are going to be longer than 4 characters. These words are based on a root word that has an adjective in front of it connected using a dash. A composite word can have up to 8 significant characters. 
6. Long numerals are created using symbol (+) that is pronounced (i). Numerals are explained in a different document. Connecting numbers with (+) instead of (-) has a significance of addition and this can avoid confusions when you read a word. 

**coda:**

* Most nouns are finalized with vowels: {"a", "e", "i"}
* Verbs are finalized with vowel: "u" and possible a time suffix;
* Adjectives and adverbs are finalized with "o"

**examle1:**

In this example we use the root word "rop" to make 3 distinct words:

* ropa = garment (clothing)
* ropo = dressed up
* ropu = getting dressed

**note:** Becouse of this rule, you may invent new words that make perfect sens. However we must put the word in Lexicon and have a transaltion for it to be official acceptable. Until the Lexicon is finished this rule could be useful to understand the examples better.

**examle2:**

* 


## Pronoun

Is a word that can function as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Maj pronoun is regular and have the following features:

* pronoun has 3 persons (I, II, III)
* pronoun has 2 numeral forms: singular and plural
* pronoun has 5 cases: nominative, dative, genitive, accusative and genitive

**Nominative**

Is the person or the thing who perform the action.

  2  | tu = you         | vu  = y'all
  3  | su = him, she    | zu  = they

**Dative:**

* su wazu sifo = he is resting himself
* tu joku solo = you are playing by yourself

**notes:** 
 * it is a total of: 6 x 4 = 24 pronouns
 * there is no gender differentiation for 3'rd person

## Special pronouns

**Objects:**

We can not talk with objects and objects can not talk:

* lo = it (one object or action)
* le = them (many objcts or actions)


## Verbs

Verb is a word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence, and forming the main part of the predicate of a sentence, such as hear, become, happen. Maj verbs are ending with "u". 
 
**example:1**

joku = to play

* jo joku  = I play
* tu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = he play
* nu joku  = we play
* vu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = they play

**example:2**

etu = to be 

* tu etu'pa mi xefa  = You are not my boss
* jo etu la mi xefa  = I'm my own boss

There is much more to learn about: [verbs](verbs.md)

## Adverb

Sometimes we use adverbs to augment the verb:

* jo joku'ga suvo = I play indeed often
* nu joku'do moxo = we will play soon
* zu joku'be reqo = they have played recently

**composite**

xai = times ( x = ora)

* ni'xai  = never
* un'xai  = once 
* du'xai  = twice
* ri'xai  = three times
* im'xai  = forever

**order**

era  = hierarchy (order)

* un'era  = first 
* du'era  = second
* ri'era  = third
* ni'era  = last

## Proposition

Structure of proposition: Subject + verb'time + objective + adverb.

verb: vidu  = to see

* jo vidu tu un'xai!  = I seen you one time!
* su vidu vu ni'xai!  = He never seen y'all!
* tu vidu mi suv!     = You will see me often!
* nu podo sh vidu zu! = We can see them!

## Imperative

In Maj, "hay" is used as an determinant call, preposition:

hai = c'mon (come on)
hai = let's (let us)

* hai sh katu su = let's search for him
* hai nu dovu sh katu zu = c'mon we must search for them
* hai sh katu su taxe = let's search his pockets

## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
pa?     | not?     | no?     | nu?
ke?     | what?    | qué     | ce
ki?     | who?     | quien   | cine

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

Maj  | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
-----|----------|---------|---------|---------------
 uta | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
 uvo | where?   | donde   | about what location?
 ura | why?     | por qué | for what reason?

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke moku tu  ?  = what are you eating ?
* ki sonu tu  ?  = who are you?   
* ki sonu ala ?  = who was there?

Asking about location can be explicit using: uvo = where:

* uvo te andu? = where are you going?
* uvo te venu? = where are you coming from?
* uvo te sonu? = where are you from?
    
Sometimes question word: "uvo", "uto" is used to indicate a response and not a question:

* es la loka uvo te joku! = is the place where you play!
* es la tema uta zu venu! = is the time when they arrive!

## Responses

The interrogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

**familiar**

* ia = yes/ affirmative
* pa = not/ negative

**logical**

* vero!  = true, affirmative
* faso!  = false, negative, 

**technical**

* juso = correct
* juso'pa = incorrect

**polite**

* bonu = good
* malo = bad
* joru = agree
* bogu = against 

## Noun

Noun is a word terminated with coda "a", "e" or "i":

* coda "a" = singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pita  = bread
* pite  = breads

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:
[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

An article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

* la = the  (singular)
* le = the  (plural)

**example**

* la pita = the bread
* le pite = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

Location   | close       | far
-----------|-------------|--------------
Singular   | eta = this  |  ela = that
Plural     | ete = these |  ele = those

**example:**

sonu = to exist

* eta sonu pana = this is bred
* ete sonu pane = these are breads
* ela sonu pana = that is bred
* ele sonu pane = those are breads

3. Descriptive article _descriptive form:_

* de pe = of the
* de la = from the

**example:**

* le peqe de pe faca mia = the freckles of my face;
* jo sonu de la Romhnia  = I'm from the Romania;

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* una Mercedes fon la gupa de auto = "a Mercedes from the car lot"
* una iova en hisa = "an event in history"

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* oxe = any
* evo = every
* oma = all
* plu = more 
* meo = few
* ago = some 

Noun can use singular or plural with different prepozitions:

**singular**

* emo Maza = any apple
* oni Maza = every apple

**plural**

* ome Maze = all apples
* ple Maze = more apples
* foe Maze = fewer apples
* age Maze = some apples
* ixe cen Maze = approximative 10 apples

Invariant noun terminated with consonant do not vary with the number:

* emo Mercedes = any Mercedes 
* ago Mercedes = some Mercedes
