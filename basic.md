## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian  | German
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------
ola   |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao     | Gruß
qau   |farewell  | adiós      | à bientôt  | adios     | adio        | addio    | Abschied

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* muda = world      
* tuto = everyone

**examples:**

* ola muda = hello world
* qau tuto = farewell everyone

## Words

A word is a rapid succession of sounds without pause. Maj have two kind of words: basic words and composite words. Words are used together in propositions. Sometimes a word can have different roles but most of the time one word have a single role.


**notes:**
1. Most words are 4 character long. Usually a word start with a consonant or a vowel and ends with a vowel. This rule makes words easy to connect together in propositions using articles.
2. A word has a _root_ and a _coda_. Root is invariable, but changing the _coda_ will slightly change the meaning of the word. The words having same root are related. 
3. Words having a root and coda can not exist without the a coda. You can add a suffix to a word after the coda. A short root word may be totally unrelated a longer word created with the root + coda.
4. Some words can end with a consonant. Last consonant is called _stop_ and is voiceless. Usually these words represent prepositions, numerals or nouns that have no plural. Usually materials and fluids or names can end with a consonant.

**coda:**

* Most nouns are finalized with vowels: {"a", "e", "i"}
* Verbs are finalized with vowel: "u" and possible a time suffix;
* Adjectives and adverbs are finalized with "o"
* Most prepositions start with a vowel and have a simple form: VCV (3 letters).

**examle:**

In this example we use the root word "rop" to make 3 distinct words:

* ropa = garment (clothing)
* ropo = dressed up
* ropu = getting dressed

**note:** Becouse of this rule, you may invent new words that make perfect sens. However we must put the word in Lexicon and have a transaltion for it to be official acceptable. Until the Lexicon is finished this rule could be useful to understand the examples better.

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Maj pronoun is regular and have the following features:

* pronoun has 3 persons (I, II, III)
* pronoun has 2 numeral forms: singular and plural
* pronoun has 5 cases: nominative, dative, genitive, accusative and genitive

**Nominative**

Is the person or the thing who perform the action.

  ps |singular          | plural

  1  | jo = I           | nu  = we
  2  | tu = you         | vu  = y'all
  3  | su = him, she    | zu  = they

**Dative:**

Indicate the person or object recipient of an action.

**stressed:**

* lo daru cu mi    = give it to me
* lo daru cu te    = I will give this to you
 
**Genitive**

This case is used to express possession or properties.

 pe tine = on you    | pe voi omi = on you all
 pe sine = on him    | pe zhi omi = on they all

**Reflexive**

Maj has two reflexive forms: firs is using pronoun

------------------------|--------------------------------
 jo mh = myself         | nu ne = ourself

Second reflexive is using adjectiv: "sifo" = "self"
  
singular                   | plural
---------------------------|--------------------------------
 mi sifo = myself;         |  nu sifo = ourselves; 
 tu sifo = yourself;       |  vu sifo = yourselves; 
 su sifo = himself/ itself |  zu sifo = themselves; 

**examples**

* su wazu sifo = he is resting himself
* tu joku solo = you are playing by yourself

**notes:** 
 * it is a total of: 6 x 4 = 24 pronouns
 * there is no gender differentiation for 3'rd person

## Special pronouns

**Objects:**

We can not talk with objects and objects can not talk:

* lo = it (one object)
* le = them (many objcts)


## Verbs

Verb is a word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence, and forming the main part of the predicate of a sentence, such as hear, become, happen. Maj verbs are ending with "u". 
 
**example:1**

joku = to play

* jo joku  = I play
* tu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = he play
* nu joku  = we play
* vu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = they play

**example:2**

etu = to be 

* tu etu'pa mi xefa  = You are not my boss
* jo etu la mi xefa  = I'm my own boss

There is much more to learn about: [verbs](verbs.md)

## Adverb

Sometimes we use adverbs to augment the verb:

* jo joku'ga suvo = I play indeed often
* nu joku'do moxo = we will play soon
* zu joku'be reqo = they have played recently

**composite**

xai = times ( x = ora)

* ni'xai  = never
* un'xai  = once 
* du'xai  = twice
* ri'xai  = three times
* im'xai  = forever

**order**

era  = hierarchy (order)

* un'era  = first 
* du'era  = second
* ri'era  = third
* ni'era  = last

## Proposition

Structure of proposition: Subject + verb'time + objective + adverb.

verb: vidu  = to see

* jo vidu tu un'xai!  = I seen you one time!
* su vidu vu ni'xai!  = He never seen y'all!
* tu vidu mi suv!     = You will see me often!
* nu podo sh vidu zu! = We can see them!

## Imperative

In Maj, "hay" is used as an determinant call, preposition:

hai = c'mon (come on)
hai = let's (let us)

* hai sh katu su = let's search for him
* hai nu dovu sh katu zu = c'mon we must search for them
* hai sh katu su taxe = let's search his pockets

## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
pa?     | not?     | no?     | nu?
ke?     | what?    | qué     | ce
ki?     | who?     | quien   | cine

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

maj        | New | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
-----------|-----|----------|---------|---------------
de ke tepa?| uta | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
de ke loka?| uda | where?   | donde   | about what location?
de ke reza?| ure | why?     | por qué | for what reason?

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke moku tu  ?  = what are you eating ?
* ki sonu tu  ?  = who are you?   
* ki sonu ala ?  = who was there?

Asking about location can be explicit using "ke loka":

* de ke loka te andu? = where are you going?
* de ke loka te venu? = where are you coming from?
* de ke loka te senu? = where are you from?
    
Sometimes "ke" is used to indicate a response and not a question:

* es la loka ke te joku! = is the place you play!
* es la tema ke zu venu! = is the time they arrive!

**expressions**
  
You can use `uda` instead of `loka`.
  
* de uda cu uda? = from where to where!
* de aki cu ala! = from here to there!

## Responses

The interrogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

**familiar**

* si = yes/ affirmative
* pa = not/ negative

**polite**

* ceto = indeed
* juso = right
* vero = true
* faso = false


**logical**

* vero!  = true, affirmative
* faso!  = false, negative, 

**scientific**
For stronger assurance answer you can specify the logical values:

* bon, bono! = good, tasteful
* mal, malo! = bad, repulsive

**composite**

* pan-juso = incorrect, not justified
* nam-juso = to be justified

## Noun

Noun is a word terminated with coda:

* coda "a" = singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pita  = bread
* pite  = breads

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:
[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

An article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

* la = the  (singular)
* le = the  (plural)

**example**

* la pita = the bread
* le pite = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

Location   | close       | far
-----------|-------------|--------------
Singular   | eta = this  |  ela = that
Plural     | ete = these |  ele = those

**example:**

sonu = to exist

* eta sonu pana = this is bred
* ete sonu pane = these are breads
* ela sonu pana = that is bred
* ele sonu pane = those are breads

3. Descriptive article _descriptive form:_

* de pe = of the
* de la = from the

**example:**

* le peqe de pe faca mia = the freckles of my face
* jo sonu de la Romhnia  = I'm from the Romania

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* una Mercedes fon la gupa de auto = "a Mercedes from the car lot"
* una iova en hisa = "an event in history"

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* emo = any
* oni = every
* omi = all
* plu = more 
* mio = few
* ago = some 
* ixo = approximative

Noun can use plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

**singular**

* emo Maza = any apple
* oni Maza = every apple

**plural**

* omi Maze = all apples
* plu Maze = more apples
* mio Maze = fewer apples
* ago Maze = some apples
* ixo cen Maze = approximative 10 apples

Invariant noun terminated with consonant do not vary with the number:

* emo Mercedes = any Mercedes 
* ago Mercedes = some Mercedes
