## Article prepositions

An article is a word used to modify a noun, which is a person, place, object, or idea. Technically, an article is an adjective, which is any word that modifies a noun. Usually adjectives modify nouns through description, but articles are used instead to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 

There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite Article**

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those


Let's begin by looking at the definite article. This article is the word 'the,' and it refers directly to a specific noun or groups of nouns. For example:

* the freckles on my face
* the alligator in the pond
* the breakfast burrito on my plate

Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific.

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj, indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* uno Mercedes = a Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 

Other numeral articles:

oru = any
omi = every
ale = all
mot = many
poc = few
van = several
som = some 
non = none


**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)

**patterns** 

* ita  pana    = the bread
* ite  pana    = these breads
* ita  acua    = the water
* ita  bana    = the banana
* ite  bana    = these bananas
* ita  huga    = the juice  
  
* ite  cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* ita  hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* ite  cheola  = the chocolate drops with alcohol
* ita  hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol 

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Pronouns have 3 cases in Maj:

* nominative
* objective
* possessive

**Nominative**

Is the person who perform the action.

  2  | te = you      | vu = you
  3  | hi = he       | zu = they
  3  | xi = she      | 
  3  | li = it       | 


**Objective**

  p | singular  | plural

 1  | my  = me  | ny = us
 2  | ty  = you | vy = you all
 3  | hy  = he  | zy = them
 3  | xy  = her | 
 3  | ly  = it  | 

**Possessive**

Is a composite word for a person or object who own something or have something.

haru = to have

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
meo = mine  | nuo = ours
teo = yours | vuo = yours
hio = his   | zuo = theirs
xio = hers  | xuo = theirs
lio = its   | luo = theirs

## Time prepositions

Information for time is ending with "u".

tepa = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

**nouns:**

* futa  = future
* resa  = present  
* pasa  = past

**examples:**

* nara de futa = a story from future
* dica de pasa = talk about the past

**sufix:**

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
ure     | present (in general now)
ugo     | present (continuum present)
ufu     | sometime in the future
upa     | sometime in the past

**time based greetings**

* foa   = sometime 
* nuc   = never (Spanish nunca
* suv   = often (French souvent)
* mox   = soon  (Latin mox)
* nau   = now   (English)

**examples**

vidu  = to see

* to vid'ufu suv ita my!  = you will see me often!
* to vid'ure foa ita my!  = you can see me sometime!
* jo vid'upa nuc ita ty!  = I have never seen you before!
* jo vid'ugo nau ita vy!  = I see you all now!

Structure of above propositions: Subject + verb'time + adverb + article + pronoun.

**notes:**

* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that was singular but is no longer used.
* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural, so y'all is redundant.


**singular conjugation**

* zi joc'ure = he is playing right now
* zi joc'ufu = he will play in the future 
* zi joc'upa = he play some time ago

**plural conjugation**
* ni joc algo = we play sometimes
* vi joc nuco = you never play
* zi joc suvo = they play often

## Verb transformation

You can transform a verb into an attribute using suffix 'uxa

**to adjective:**

jocu => joc'uxa = playful

**So far:**
* je ser joc'uxo = I'm playful
* ve ser joc'uxo = you are playful 
* ze ser joc'uxo = he is playful

**to noun:**

Use termination 'ina to make a noun, 'ira.

* je ser'upa una joc'ira = I was a player
* ne ser'ufu joc'ira     = we will be players

## Locations

* Locations are very important in Maj.
* Common locations are nouns so they are terminated in "a".
