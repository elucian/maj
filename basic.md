* ce papa  = what are you eating ?
* co papa  = how is your food  ?
* co bebe  = how is your drink ?
* ud sera  = where are you?

## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural.
     
singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

**Pronoun**

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular      | plural
--------------|-----------------------------
mi  = myself  | ne = we
ti  = you     | ve = you
hi  = he/she  | ze = they

**Possessive**

To have = hara

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
mia = mine  | nue = ours
tia = yours | vue = yours
hia = his   | zue = theirs

**Notes:**

* pronouns are always using lowercase characters,
* pronoun can replacing the article role,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"

**Time:**

Information for time is ending with "u".

tepu = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word


rasu  = present 
fasu  = feature
pasu  = past

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
ga      | infinitive (no time)
ra      | present (now)
fa      | sometime in the future
pa      | sometime in the past
na      | never 

**time based greetings**

Using verb: veda = to see

* to veda-ra  = see you soon
* to veda-fa  = see you sometime
* to veda-pa  = see you sometime
* to veda-na  = I will never see you again

**singular conjugation**

* hi pala-ra = he is playing right now
* hi pala-fa = he will play in the future 
* hi pala-pa = he play some time ago
* hi pala-na = he never play

**plural conjugation**
* ne pala-ga = we all play 
* ve pala-ga = you all play
* ze pala-ga = they all play 

**Notes:** 

* So far I have inspired from Spanish a little.
* Having fix verbs make the learning experience better.

## Transform a verb in attribute using "sy"

paly = playful

**So far:**
* mi sera pala-sy = I'm playful
* ti sera pala-sy = you are playful 
* hi sera pala-sy = he, it or she is playful

## Locations

* Locations are so important in Maj.
* Common locations are terminated in "u".

locu = location
