**operations**

Maj | English | Description

no  | no      | negative 
or  | or      | alternative
et  | and     | conjunctive

**symbols**

When used in text some symbols are read out loud:

* symbol `+` is read et
* symbol `/` is read or
* symbol `:` is read con (used for pair-up or time)

**Interrogative:**

Interrogation is created with { qui, que, quo }:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
qui     | who?     | quien   | cine
que     | what?    | qué     | ce
quo     | how?     | como    | cum

**using verb**

Most questions are using verbs:

* qui seru're?  = who is ?
* que magu're?  = what are you eating ?
* quo bebu'pa?  = how was your drink ?   

## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural for the subject.
     
singular    | plural
------------|-------------
ica = the   | ice = the (many)
ita = this  | ite = these
isa = that  | ise = those

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular       | plural
---------------|-----------------------------
je, mi = I     | ne = we
tu, ti = you   | ve = you
zi = he        | ze = they
xi = she       | xe = they
it = it        | 

**Note:**

Maj is not 100% perfect:

* There are two forms of singular for first and second person.
* There is a feminine for third person, singular but not plural.
* The "it" is for things and do not have a plural form.

**Possessive**

haru = to have

singular        | plural
----------------|--------------------------------
mia = mine      | nos = ours
tia = yours     | vos = yours
zia = his       | zos = theirs
xia = hers      | 

**Notes:**

* pronouns are always using lowercase characters,
* pronoun can replacing the article role therefore is terminated with ,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"
* nue, vue, zue is pronounced "nwe, vwem zwe" but in Maj there is no "w"

**Time:**

Information for time is ending with "u".

tepa = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

**nouns:**

* futa  = future
* resa  = present  
* pasa  = past

**examples:**

* nara de futa = a story from future
* dica de pasa = talk about the past

**sufix:**

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
re      | present (now)
fu      | sometime in the future
pa      | sometime in the past

**time based greetings**

* vidu  = to see
* algo  = sometime
* nuco  = never
* suvo  = often (French souvent)
* moxo  = soon  (Latin mox)

* tu vidu'fu suvo ita mi. = you will see me often
* tu vidu're algo ita mi. = you can see me sometime
* je vidu'pa nuco ita ti. = I have never seen you before

Structure of above propositions: Subject + verb + adverb + article + pronoun.

**notes:**

* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural,
* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that is no longer used.

**singular conjugation**

* zi jocu're = he is playing right now
* zi jocu'fu = he will play in the future 
* zi jocu'pa = he play some time ago

**plural conjugation**
* ne jocu algo = we play sometimes
* ve jocu nuco = you never play
* ze jocu suvo = they play often

## Verb transformation

You can transform a verb into an attribute using suffix 'xa

* sha for singular
* she for plural

**to adjective:**

jocu => jocu'xa = playful

**So far:**
* je seru jocu'xa = I'm playful
* tu seru jocu'xa = you are playful 
* zi seru jocu'xa = he is playful

**to noun:**

Use termination "sa" to make a noun.

* je seru'pa una jocu'sa = I was a player
* ne seru'fu jocu'sa     = we will be players

## Locations

* Locations are very important in Maj.
* Common locations are nouns so they are terminated in "a".

loca = location (noun)
