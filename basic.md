Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------
ciao  |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao

## Words

A word can have a specialized role in a sentence. 

* Nouns are finalized with {"a","y","e"} or any consonant;
* Verbs are finalized with {"u", "i"} or suffix, "so", "fu", "pa";
* Adjectives are finalized with {"o", "w"} or a consonant;
* Adverbs like adjectives are finalized with vowel "o" or consonant;
* Pronouns are 2 or 3 letter long and can terminate with {"o","u","i","y" or "s"};
* Prepositions are also 2 or 3 letter long and can terminate with any letter;
* Determinants are monosyllabic prepositions, 2 - 3 letter long;
* Interjection is monosyllabic and usually start with "w";

**note:**
For word creation we have a strong rule that is very useful: A word in general start with a consonant or a vowel but should end with a vowel. This rule makes words easy to connect in a phrase using conjunctions, articles or direct.

## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
ke      | what?    | qué     | ce
ky      | who?     | quien   | cine
ku      | how?     | como    | cum
ko      | which?   | cual    | care
ka      | no?      | non     | nu?

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

maj        |New  | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
-----------|-----|----------|---------|---------------
de ke tesa?|uta  | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
de ke loka?|ubi  | where?   | donde   | about what location?
de ke reza?|ura  | why?     | por qué | for what reason?

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke magu'fu tu  ?  = what are you going to eat ?
* ky seru'pa ybi ?  = who was there?
* ku seru'so tu  ?  = how are you ?   
* ka magu'fu tu  ?  = you have not eaten ?

Asking about location can be explicit using que:

* de ke loka ti andu ? = where are you going?
* de ke loka ti venu ? = where are you coming from?
* de ke loka ti seru ? = where are you from?
    
You can ask about location isomg `ubi` or time isomg `cud`:

* es la loka ke tu joku? = is the place you play?
* es la tesa ke zu venu? = is the time they come?

**expressions**
  
You can use `von ubi`, or `tsu ubi` instead of `loka`.
  
* von ubi tsu ubi? = from where to where!

Possible answers:

* von hir tsu ybi! = from here to there!
* von loka ke tu picu!  = from a place you like!
* von tesa ke lo oviu!  = from a forgotten time!

verb: oveu = to forget

## Responses

**familiar**

* si / asi = ye / yes
* ka / kan = no /  not


**polite**

* cero = indeed
* juso = right
* fawo = wrong

**logical**

## Noun

* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

* la  = the (singular)
* le  = the (plural)

**example**

* le pene = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

es = it is (seru) = to be

elo = that |  ele = those

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* una Mergedes fon la gupa de auto = a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* oru = any
* omi = every
* ali = all
* mot = many
* pau = few
* van = several
* som = some 
* yxo = approximative

Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

* una mela = one apple
* dua mele = two apples
* omi mela = every apple
* oru mela = any apple
* som mele = some apples
* ali mele = all apples
* mot mele = many apples
* yxo diz male = approximative 10 apples
