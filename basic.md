# Basic Grammar

## Logic

Existential verbs are part of logic:

ser, sera = to be     
har, hara = to have   
ave, avea = to posses 
ase, asea = to do
cur, cura = to occur/happening
and, anda = to go
vid, vida = to see
aud, auda = ti hear
pas, pasa = to happen
can, cana = to be able (kan do)
hut, huta = should 

* Root of verb is follos by "a" to "infinitive" case.
* Logical values are: {vre, fau}, from French.

**Notes:** 

* So far I have inspired from Spanish a little.
* Having fix verbs make the learning effort smaller.

* Verb is loosing last focal and it is replaced by "y"

**So far:**
* mu ese paly = I'm playful
* tu ese paly = you are playful 
* su ese paly = he, it or she is playful
