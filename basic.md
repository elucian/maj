* How to say greetings
* Pronouns and cases
* Verb tense
* Noun article
* Some prepositions

## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian  | German
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------
qau   |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao     | Gruß
bau   |farewell  | adiós      | à bientôt  | adios     | adio        | addio    | Abschied

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* muna = world      (from latin: mundo)
* luna = moon       (just in case you may be confused)

**examples:**

* qau muna = hello world
* bau todo = farewell all

## Words

A word is a composition of sounds in a rapid succession without a pause. Maj have two kind of words: basic words and composite words. Words are used together in propositions. Sometimes a word can have different roles but most of the time one word can have a single role.


**notes:**
1. A word in general start with a consonant or a vowel and ends with a vowel. This rule makes words easy to connect together in propositions using articles.
2. A word has a _root_ and a _coda_. Root is invariable, but changing the _coda_ will change the meaning of the word. The words having same root are related. 
3. Words having a root and coda can not exist without the a coda. You can add a suffix to a word after the coda, but a root word without the coda can be something else. A shorter root word may be totally unrelated a longer word created with the root + coda.

**coda:**

* Nouns are finalized with vowels: Group1: {"a", "e"}, Group2:{"y", "h"};
* Verbs are finalized with vowels: Tense1:  {"a","u","o"} and Suffix: { 'ya, 'fu, 'pa };
* Adjectives and Adverbs are finalized with any letter and must agree with the verb;
* Prepositions are two or three letter long and do not have coda;

**root:**

In dictionary the root is using a particular coda, to avoid a large dictionary.

* The nouns are terminated with "a" (singular form)
* The verbs are terminated with "u" (indefinite future) 
* The adverbs and adjectives with ("o" or "y")

## Pronoun

## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
ka?     | no?      | non     | nu?
ke?     | what?    | qué     | ce
ki?     | who?     | quien   | cine
komo?   | how?     | como    | cum
karo?   | which?   | cual    | care

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

maj        |New  | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
-----------|-----|----------|---------|---------------
de ke tesa?|uta  | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
de ke loka?|ubi  | where?   | donde   | about what location?
de ke reza?|ura  | why?     | por qué | for what reason?

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke magu'fa tu  ?  = what are you going to eat ?
* ki seru'pa ibo ?  = who was there?
* ku seru'ia tu  ?  = how are you ?   
* ka magu'fa tu  ?  = you have not eaten ?

Asking about location can be explicit using que:

* de ke loka te andu? = where are you going?
* de ke loka te venu? = where are you coming from?
* de ke loka te seru? = where are you from?
    
You can ask about location isomg `ubi` or time isomg `cud`:

* es la loka ke te joku? = is the place you play?
* es la tesa ke zu venu? = is the time they come?

**expressions**
  
You can use `von ubi` instead of `loka`.
  
* von ubi cu ubi? = from where to where!
* von hir cu ibo! = from here to there!

## Responses

The interrogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

**familiar**

* si / asi = yes / so
* ka / kan = not / non

**polite**

* cero = indeed
* juso = right
* fawo = wrong

**logical**

* vero!  = true, affirmative
* faso!  = false, negative, 
* xako!  = unknown

**scientific**
For stronger assurance answer you can specify the logical values:

* bono! = good, tasteful
* malo! = bad, repulsive

**composite**

* kan-juso = incorrect, not justified
* nam-juso = to be justified

## Noun

* coda "a" = singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pana  = bread
* pane  = breads

[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

An article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

* la  = the (singular)
* le  = the (plural)

**example**

* la pana = the bread
* le pene = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

Location   | close       | far
-----------|-------------|--------------
Singular   | eta = this  |  ela = that
Plural     | ete = these |  ele = those

**example:**

es (seru) = to be

* eta es pana = this is bred
* ete es pane = these are breads
* ela es pana = that is bred
* ele es pane = those are breads

3. Descriptive article _descriptive form:_

* de    = of 
* de la = of the

**example:**

* English: the freckles of my face
* Spanish: las pecas de mi cara
* Maj: le peqe de mia cara

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* una Mercedes fon la gupa de auto = "a Mercedes from the car lot"
* una iova in hisa = "an event in history"

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* ago = any
* omi = every
* ale = all
* mai = many
* plu = more 
* pau = few
* van = several (some)
* som = some 
* ixo = approximative

Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

* una mela = one apple
* dua mele = two apples
* omi mela = every apple
* ago mela = any apple
* som mele = some apples
* ali mele = all apples
* mot mele = many apples
* ixo diz male = approximative 10 apples

Invariant noun is terminated in "s" or other consonant:

* pau Mercedes = few Mercedes 
* ago Mercedes = any Mercedes
