## Words

A word can have a specialized role in a sentence. 

* Nouns are finalized with {"a","e","y"} or any consonant;
* Verbs are finalized with suffix "u", "ure", "ufu", "upa";
* Adjectives are finalized with "o" or any consonant;
* Adverbs are finalized with vowel "o" or any consonant;
* Pronouns are monosyllabic, 2 or 3 letter long;
* Prepositions are monosyllabic, 2 or 3 letter long;
* Determinants are monosyllabic prepositions, 2 - 3 letter long;

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

**Pronouns cases:**

* nominative
* objective
* possessive

**Nominative**

Is the person or the thing who perform the action.

  ps |singular       | plural
-----|---------------|-----------------------------
  1  | jo = I        | noi  = we
  2  | tu = you      | voi  = y'all
  3  | zi = he, it   | zoi  = they (masculine) 
  3  | xi = she      | xoi  = they (feminine)

**Objective**

Is the person or the thing who receive the action.

 ps | singular        | plural
----|-----------------|-----------------------------
 1  | my = me         | noy = us
 2  | ty = you        | voy = you
 3  | zy = him        | zoy = them (masculine)
 4  | xy = her        | xoy = them (feminine)   

 
**Possessive**

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
mia = mine  | nue = ours
tia = your  | vue = yours
zia = his   | zue = their
xia = her   | xue = their

**notes:**

* Maj language do not have form for "it". You can use "hi" to talk about a thing or a person;
* Pronoun "y'all" is the plural form of previous "thou", that was replaced by "you";
* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural, so y'all is redundant;
* In English objective case is also using you so Objective can not be translated in English;

**Reflexive**

To make reflexive we use coda "sy"

* misy = myself;
* tisy = yourself; 
* zisy = himself; 
* xisy = herself; 
* lasy = itself; 
* busy = ourselves; 
* vusy = yourselves; 
* zusy = themselves.

upa     | pasa       |  past


**singular conjugation**

verb: jocu = to play

* jo jocu    = I play

## Interrogative

Interrogation is created with interrogative prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
que     | what?    | qué     | ce
qui     | who?     | quien   | cine
quo     | how?     | como    | cum
qua     | which?   | cual    | care
ubi     | where?   | donde   | unde
uta     | when?    | cuando  | când
uro     | why?     | por qué | de ce 

**Notice:**

* `u` after `q` is silent, so you say: `ke`, `ki` or `ko`.
* `u` ate beginning of word and after `c` is voiced, so you say: {`ubi`, `uta`, `uro`}

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* qui ser'upa der?  = who whas there?
* que mag'ufu te ?  = what are you going to eat ?
* quo ser'ure tea beba ?  = how is your drink ?   

Asking about location can be explicit using que:

* que loca te and'ure? = where are you going?
* que loca te ven'ure? = where are you coming from?
* que loca te ser'ure? = where are you from?
    
You can ask about location isomg `ubi` or time isomg `cud`:

* ubi seru la loca que tu jocu? = where is the place you play?
* uta seru la topa que zu venu? = when  is the time they come?

**expressions**
  
You can use `von ubi`, or `tsu ubi` instead of `loca`.
  
* von ubi tsu ubi? = from where to where!

Possible answers:

* von hir tsu dor! = from here to there!
* von loca que te picu!  = from a place you like!
* von topa que ne ovi'upa!  = from a forgotten time!

verb: oveu = to forget

## Response

The interogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

* oga = yes, affirmative
* nok = no,  negative 

For stronger assurance answer you can specify the logical values:

* vero = true, affirmative 
* faso = false, negative

## Noun

Noun is a word terminated with coda:

* coda "a" = singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pana  = bread
* aqua  = water
* bane  = bananas
* huga  = juice  
* peca  = freckles
* cara  = face

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:
[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

In maj, article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

Definite article indicative form:

la  = the   (singular)
le  = the   (plural)

Definite article determinant form:

es / el = it 

Singular   |  Plural
-----------|--------------
eso = this |  ese = these 
elo = that |  ele = those

Definite article descriptive form:

da  = about one
de  = about many

**example:**

* English: the freckles on my face
* Spanish: las pecas en mi cara
* Maj: le pece da mia cara

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* uno = one
* abo = both
* oru = any
* omi = every
* ale = all
* mot = many
* pau = few
* van = several
* som = some 

Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:


* uno mela = one apple
* omi apla = every apple
* oru apla = any apple
* som mele = some aples
* due mele = two apples
* ale mele = all apples


Invariant noun is terminated in "s" or other consonant:


* pau Mercedes = few Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 


## Determinant

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant to create a new meaning for words:

* non  = not - create antonyms
* pro  = for - specify purpose

```
pro bebo aqua = drinking water
non bebo aqua = industrial water
non bolo beba = non alcoholic drink
```

**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)

**normal** 

* la pana = the bread
* la aqua = the water
* la bana = the banana
* la huga = the juice  

**harmful**

* la cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* la cheola  = the chocolate drops with alcohol
* la hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* la hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol 

## Logic conjunction

A word used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause.

Conjunction is used when...

* you have two ideas and you want to connect them in a sentence;
* an idea you have, depends on another idea;
* you want to add a new idea into an existing one;

## Coding

Maj text can be "rendered" or executed using a Maj hosting service;

**Symbols**

{ + - / ? ! . : = * ; # ` _ ~ [ ] ( )}

1. One star `* ` follow by one space at the beginning of line start a bullet list;
1. Number `1. `  follow by dot that at beginning of line start a numbered list;
1. Use `;` to separate propositions and lists;
1. Text enclosed with `**` becomes **bold** and represents comment;
1. Any text that start with `_` becomes _italic_;
1. Any text that start with `~` becomes ~strike~;
1. Notation `[Text](URL)` is used to create hyper-links;
1. Symbol `#` is header, `##` sub-header (enlarged font);
1. Commented text HTML notation: <!-- .... --> is supported;
1. Enumerations are separated by comma, and enclose in brackets `{a,b,c}`;
1. Use triple back-quotes for inclusion of any foreign language text; 
1. Use `$` to declare variable in code or in form;
1. Use `@` to declare vector column or row;
1. Use `&` to concatenate variables in expressions;

**variables**

You can create a variable anywhere in the Maj text

@PI   = 3.14 ** constant

```
$var1 = 24, $var2 = 35  ** two variables
$var2 = {1,2,3} ** a set of variables
$var3 = [1,1,1] ** a list of variables
```

**expressions**

Use round parentheses for expressions like in following example:

This expression "var1 + PI" has value ($var1 + @PI);

**code block**

You can create code in Maj using notation `maj:`

maj: _code-name_

Use 3 back-quotes \`\`\` to create a block of code:

```
** This is a block of code
```

**Read more:** [code](code.md)

**markup**

Maj enable markup code. That can be HTML, or XML

<html>
  <h1>Static HTML </h1>  
  <p> Maj interpreter will not touch the HTML code, 
      so it can be used only for static content. </p>
  <p> For dynamic content you can use only expressions </p>    
</html>

## Input form

To create an input form you can use a input:

input: 

 Label        | Values      
--------------|--------------------------------
"$var1"       | $var1 = 0    
"$var2"       | $var2 = 0    
TOTAL         | $var1 + $var2

* first input  = ($var1)
* second input = ($var2)

**notes**

* You can specify initial value using "=";
* You can use functions or expressions to output text;
 
## Dynamic form

You can create a dynamic form using multiple rows:

input: 10/5

 "@values()"  | Values      
--------------|--------------------------------
 ...          | @values
 TOTAL        | 0 + @values

* "@values(1) =" @values(1)
* "@values(2) =" @values(2)

## Matrix form

You can create a dynamic form using multiple columns:

input: 3,3/5 

 Index        | Values         | Total
--------------|----------------|----------------
 ...          | @values        | +@values
 TOTAL        |+@values        | +@values

* "@values(1,1) =" @values (1,1)
* "@values(2,2) =" @values (2,2)


**notes**

* You can specify index number using `...`
* You can specify multiple values using @values
* Using 20 you specify 20 active rows for @values
* Using /5 you can create a form with 5 active rows and scroll bar


Great!
