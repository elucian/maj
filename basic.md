**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* salu = bless you  (interjection: when somebody is sneezing

* Adverbs are usually finalized with vowel "o" or a consonant;
* Pronouns are monosyllabic, 2 or 3 letter long;
* Prepositions are monosyllabic, 2 or 3 letter long;
* Determinants are monosyllabic prepositions, 2 - 3 letter long;

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Pronouns have 3 cases in Maj:

* nominative
* objective
* possessive

**Nominative**

Is the person who perform the action.

  p  |singular       | plural
-----|---------------|-----------------------------
  1  | jo = I        | nu = we
  2  | tu = you      | vu = you
  3  | hi = he       | zu = they
  3  | xi = she      | 
  3  | li = it       | 

**Objective**

Is the person who receive the action.

  p | singular  | plural
----|-----------|-----------------------------
 1  | me  = me  | ne = us
 2  | te  = you | ve = you all
 3  | he  = he  | ze = them
 3  | xe  = her | 
 3  | le  = it  | 

**Possessive**

hia = his   | zue = their
xia = her   | xue = their
lia = its   | lue = their

**notes:**

* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that was singular but is no longer used.
* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural, so y'all is redundant.

## Interrogative

Interrogation is created with 4 interrogative prepositions:

* que = what?
* qui = who?
* quo = how?
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
que     | what?    | qué     | ce
qui     | who?     | quien   | cine
quo     | how?     | como    | cum
ubi     | where?   | donde   | unde
uzo     | when?    | cuando  | când
uxa     | why?     | por qué | de ce 

Notice 

* `u` after `q` is silent, so you say: `ke`, `ki` or `ko`.
* `u` ate beginning of word and after `c` is voiced, so you say: {`ubi`, `kud`}

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* qui ser'upa der?  = who whas there?
* que mag'ufu te ?  = what are you going to eat ?
* quo ser'ure tea beba ?  = how is your drink ?   

Asking about location can be explicit using que:

* que loca te and'ure? = where are you going?
* que loca te ven'ure? = where are you coming from?
* que loca te ser'ure? = where are you from?
    
You can ask about location isomg `ubi` or time isomg `cud`:

* ubi seru isa loca que tu jocu? = where is the place you play?
* uzo seru isa topa que zu venu? = when  is the time they come?

**expressions**
  
You can use `von ubi`, or `tsu ubi` instead of `loca`.
  
* von ubi tsu ubi? = from where to where!

Possible answers:

* von hir tsu dor! = from here to there!
* von loca que te picu!  = from a place you like!
* von topa que ne ovi'upa!  = from a forgotten time!

verb: oveu = to forget

## Noun

A noun a person, place, object, or idea. Some nouns we are going to use as examples:

* pana  = bread
* aqua  = water
* bane  = bananas
* huga  = juice  
* peca  = freckles
* cara  = face

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:
[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

In maj, article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

Let's begin by looking at the definite article. This article is the word `the`, and it refers directly to a noun or groups of nouns. For example:

* English: the freckles on my face
* Spanish: las pecas en mi cara
* Maj: ita pece auf mia cara


Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific.

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* uno = one
* tum = both
* oru = any
* omi = every
* ale = all
* mot = many
* pau = few
* van = several
* som = some 


Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

```
uno mela = one apple
omi apla = every apple
oru apla = any apple
som mele = some aples
due mele = two apples
ale mele = all apples
```

Invariant noun:

```
pau Mercedes = few Mercedes 
oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 
```


## Determinant

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant to create a new meaning for words:

* non  = not - create antonyms
* pro  = for - specify purpose

```
pro bebo aqua = drinking water
non bebo aqua = industrial water
non bolo beba = non alcoholic drink
```

**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)

**patterns** 

* ita pana = the bread
* ite pana = these breads
* ita aqua = the water
* ita bana = the banana
* ite bana = these bananas
* ita huga = the juice  
  
* ite cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* ita hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* ite cheola  = the chocolate drops with alcohol
* ita hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol 


## Logic conjunction

A word used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause.

Conjunction is used when...

* you have two ideas and you want to connect them in a sentence;
* an idea you have, depends on another idea;
* you want to add a new idea into an existing one;
