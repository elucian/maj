# Basic Grammar

In this document we describe the basics of MAJ grammar.

* How to say greetings
* Pronouns and cases
* Verb tense
* Noun article
* Some prepositions

## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian  | German
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------
ola   |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao     | Gruß
qau   |farewell  | adiós      | à bientôt  | adios     | adio        | addio    | Abschied

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* muda = world      
* todo = everyone

**examples:**

* ola muda = hello world
* qau todo = farewell everyone

## Words

A word is a rapid succession of sounds without pause. Maj have two kind of words: basic words and composite words. Words are used together in propositions. Sometimes a word can have different roles but most of the time one word have a single role.


**notes:**
1. A regular word start with a consonant or a vowel and ends with a vowel. This rule makes words easy to connect together in propositions using articles.
2. A word has a _root_ and a _coda_. Root is invariable, but changing the _coda_ will change the meaning of the word. The words having same root are related. 
3. Words having a root and coda can not exist without the a coda. You can add a suffix to a word after the coda. A short root word may be totally unrelated a longer word created with the root + coda.
4. Longer words can end with a consonant. This is called stop consonant. These are called irregular words and are considered more expensive and therefore rarely used.

**coda:**

* Nouns are finalized with vowels: {"a", "e"}
* Verbs are finalized with vowels: {"u", "o"} and maybe Suffix: { 'na, 'da, 'ra };
* Adjectives and Adverbs are finalized with { "o", "e" }
* Prepositions are two or three letter long and do not have coda;

**root:**

In dictionary the root is using a particular coda, to avoid a large dictionary.

* Most nouns terminated with "a" 
* Some nouns terminated with "e"
* Most verbs are terminated with "u"
* Some verbs are terminated with "o"
* Adverbs and adjectives are terminated with ("o" or "i")

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Maj pronoun is regular and have the following features:

* pronoun has 3 persons (I, II, III)
* pronoun has 3 cases: nominative, objective, possessive

 3  | cu se, sie = to him/her  | cu zo, zuo = to them 
 
**Possessive**

## Reflexive

Maj has two reflexive forms: firs is using pronoun

singular                | plural
------------------------|--------------------------------
 jo mh = myself         | nu ne = ourself 
 tu te = yourself       | vu vh = yourselves
 su se = himself,itself | zu zh = themselves

**examples**

Second reflexive is using word: "sifo" = "self"

* mi sifo = myself;
* tu sifo = yourself;

* nu sifo = ourselves; 
* vu sifo = yourselves; 
* zu sifo = themselves; 

**examples**

* su wazu sifo = he is resting himself
* tu joku solo = you are playing by yourself

**notes:** 
 * it is a total of: 6 x 4 = 24 pronouns
 * there is no gender differentiation for 3'rd person

## Verbs

Verb is a word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence, and forming the main part of the predicate of a sentence, such as hear, become, happen. Maj verbs are ending with "u". 
 
**example**

Verbs are invariant relative to person or gender.

joku = to play

* jo joku  = I play
* tu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = he play
* nu joku  = we play
* vu joku  = you play
* zu joku  = they play

## Adverb

Sometimes we use adverbs to augment the verb:

* suvo  = often (French souvent)
* moxo  = soon  (Latin mox)

* jo joku suvo = I play often
* zu joku moxo = I play soon

**composite**

foa = times (* = ora)

* ni'foa  = never
* un'foa  = once 
* du'foa  = twice
* re'foa  = three times
* im'foa  = forever

**using numerals**

lio  = place (French lieu)

* un'lio  = first  place
* du'lio  = second place
* re'lio  = third   place
* ni'lio  = last place

## Proposition

Structure of proposition: Subject + verb'time + objective + adverb.

verb: vidu  = to see

* jo vidu tu un'foa!  = I seen you one time!
* su vidu vu ni'foa!  = He never seen y'all!
* tu vidu mi suv!     = You will see me often!
* nu podo sh vidu zu! = We can see them!

## Imperative

In Maj, "hay" is used as an determinant call, preposition:

hai = c'mon (come on)
hai = let's (let us)

* hai nu haru sh bosu su = c'mon we have to search him
* hai nu dovu sh bosu zu = c'mon we must search them


## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
pa?     | not?     | no?     | nu?
ke?     | what?    | qué     | ce
ki?     | who?     | quien   | cine

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

maj        |New  | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
-----------|-----|----------|---------|---------------
de ke tesa?| uta | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
de ke loka?| uda | where?   | donde   | about what location?
de ke reza?| uka | why?     | por qué | for what reason?

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke moku tu  ?  = what are you eating ?
* ki senu tu  ?  = how are you ?   
* ki senu ala ?  = who was there?

Asking about location can be explicit using "ke loka":

* de ke loka te andu? = where are you going?
* de ke loka te venu? = where are you coming from?
* de ke loka te senu? = where are you from?
    
Sometimes "ke" is used to indicate a response and not a question:

* es la loka ke te joku! = is the place you play!
* es la tesa ke zu venu! = is the time they arrive!

**expressions**

  
You can use `uda` instead of `loka`.
  
* de uda cu uda? = from where to where!
* de aki cu ala! = from here to there!

## Responses

The interrogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

**familiar**

* ia = yes/ affirmative
* pa = not/ negative

**polite**

* ceto = indeed
* juso = right
* vero = true
* faso = false


**logical**

* vero!  = true, affirmative
* faso!  = false, negative, 

**scientific**
For stronger assurance answer you can specify the logical values:

* bon, bono! = good, tasteful
* mal, malo! = bad, repulsive

**composite**

* pan-juso = incorrect, not justified
* nam-juso = to be justified

## Noun

Noun is a word terminated with coda:

* coda "a" = singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pita  = bread
* pite  = breads

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:
[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

An article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

* la = the (singular)
* le = the (plural)

**example**

* la pita = the bread
* le pite = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

Location   | close       | far
-----------|-------------|--------------
Singular   | eta = this  |  ela = that
Plural     | ete = these |  ele = those

**example:**

sona = to exist
sonu = to be

* eta sonu pana = this is bred
* ete sonu pane = these are breads
* ela sonu pana = that is bred
* ele sonu pane = those are breads

3. Descriptive article _descriptive form:_

* de pe = of the

**example:**

* English: the freckles of my face
* Spanish: las pecas de mi cara
* Maj: le peqe de pe faca mia

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* una Mercedes fon la gupa de auto = "a Mercedes from the car lot"
* una iova en hisa = "an event in history"

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* emo = any
* oni = every
* amo = all
* mua = many
* plu = more 
* pao = few
* van = several (some)
* ago = some 
* ixo = approximative

Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

* una mela = one apple
* dua mele = two apples
* oni mela = every apple
* emi mela = any apple
* ago mele = some apples
* amo mele = all apples
* mua mele = many apples
* ixo cen male = approximative 10 apples

Invariant noun is terminated in "s" or other consonant:

* pao Mercedes = few Mercedes 
* emo Mercedes = any Mercedes
