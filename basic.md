## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural.
     
singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

**Pronoun**

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular      | plural
--------------|-----------------------------
mi  = myself  | ne = we
ti  = you     | ve = you all
hi  = he/she  | ze = they

**Possessive**

haru = to have

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
mia = mine  | nue = ours
tia = yours | vue = yours
hia = his   | zue = theirs

**Notes:**

* pronouns are always using lowercase characters,
* pronoun can replacing the article role therefore is terminated with ,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"
* nue, vue, zue is pronounced "nwe, vwem zwe" but in Maj there is no "w"

**Time:**

Information for time is ending with "u".

tempa = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

ga      | sometimes soon
ra      | present (now)
fa      | sometime in the future
pa      | sometime in the past
na      | never 

**time based greetings**

Using verb: veda = to see

* ti vedu-ga  = see you soon
* ti vedu-ra  = I can see see you
* ti vedu-fa  = see you sometime
* ti vedu-pa  = I have seen you a while ago
