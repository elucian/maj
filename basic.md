# Basic Grammar

In this document we describe the basics of MAJ semantic.

## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------
helo  |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao
salu  |health    | salud      | la santé   | salutem   | sănătate    | salute
ciao  |goodbye   | adiós      | au bientot | vale      | ramas bun   | ci vediamo
adio  |farewell  | despedida  | adieu      | valeat    | adio        | addio

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* salu = bless you  (interjection: when somebody is sneezing
* salo = health     (adjective: referring to a person or animal)

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Pronouns have 3 cases in Maj:

* nominative
* objective
* possessive

**Nominative**

Is the person who perform the action.

  p  |singular       | plural
-----|---------------|-----------------------------
  1  | jo = I        | nu = we
  2  | tu = you      | vu = you
  3  | hi = he       | zu = they
  3  | xi = she      | 
  3  | la = it       | 

**Objective**

Is the person who receive the action.

  p | singular  | plural
----|-----------|-----------------------------
 1  | me  = me  | nu = us
 2  | te  = you | vu = you all
 3  | he  = he  | zu = them
 3  | xe  = her | 
 3  | le  = it  | 

**Possessive**

Is a composite word for a person or object who own something or have something.

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
meo = mine  | nue = ours
teo = yours | vue = yours
hio = his   | zue = theirs
xio = hers  | xue = theirs
lao = its   | lue = theirs

**notes:**

* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that was singular but is no longer used.
* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural, so y'all is redundant.


## Interrogative

Interrogation is created with prepositions: { qui, que, quo }:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
qui     | who?     | quien   | cine
que     | what?    | qué     | ce
quo     | how?     | como    | cum

Notice `u` after, `qu` is silent, so you should say: `ki`, `ke` or `ko`.

**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* qui ser'ure der?  = who is there?
* que mag'ugo te ?  = what are you eating ?
* quo ser'upa tia beba ?  = how was your drink ?   

Preposition ubi can be used for questions about location:

**short form**
* ubi and'ure ti? = where are you going?
* ubi ven'ure ti? = where are you coming from?
* ubi ser'ure ti? = where are you from?
    
**longer form**    
* ubi seru isa loca que ti joc'ugo? = where is the place you are plaing?
* ubi seru isa loca que ni and'ugo? = where is the place we  are going?

**expressions**
  
* von ubi tsu ubi? = from where to where!
* von hir tsu der! = from here to there!
* von loca que ti picu!  = from where you like!


## Noun

A noun a person, place, object, or idea. Some nouns we are going to use as examples:

* pana  = bread
* aqua  = water
* bane  = bananas
* huga  = juice  
* peca  = freckles
* cara  = face

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:

## Article

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

Let's begin by looking at the definite article. This article is the word `the`, and it refers directly to a noun or groups of nouns. For example:

* Maj: ita peca auf mia cara => 
* English: the freckles on my face
* Spanish: las pecas en mi cara

Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific.

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj, indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* uno Mercedes = a Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 

Other numeral articles:

oru = any
omi = every
ale = all
mot = many
pau = few
van = several
som = some 

## Determinant

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant to create a new meaning for words:

* non  = not - create antonyms
* pro  = for - specify purpose

```
pro bebo aqua = drinking water
non bebo aqua = industrial water
non bola beba = non alcoholic drink
```

**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)

**patterns** 

* ita  pana    = the bread
* ite  pana    = these breads
* ita  aqua    = the water
* ita  bana    = the banana
* ite  bana    = these bananas
* ita  huga    = the juice  
  
* ite  cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* ita  hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* ite  cheola  = the chocolate drops with alcohol
* ita  hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol 

## Logic conjunction

A word used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause.

Conjunction is used when...

* you have two ideas and you want to connect them in a sentence;
* an idea you have, depends on another idea;
* you want to add a new idea into an existing one;
