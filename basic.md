# Logic

**Interrogative:**

Interrogation is created with { ci, ce, co, cu } from Italian: {chi, che, como}

ci?   | who?     | que     | cine
ce?   | what?    | qué     | ce
co?   | how?     | como    | cum
ou?   | where?   | dónde   | unde
      
* ci sera  = who is ?
* ce hara  = how is he like ?

* ou sera  = where are you?

**notes:** 

* Symbol "ci" is pronounced like Spanish "qu",
* Symbol "ou" is pronounced like Franch "ou".

## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural.
     
---------------------------------------------
la  = this  
las = these
lo  = that
los = those   
---------------------------------------------

**Pronoun**

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular      | plural
--------------|-----------------------------
me = myself   | mes = we
te = you      | tes = you
se = he/she   | ses = they

**Possessive**

singular   | plural
-----------|--------------------------------
ma = mine  | mas = ours
ta = yours | tas = yours
sa = his   | sas = theirs

**Notes:**

* pronouns are always using lowercase characters,
* pronoun can replacing the article role,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"

**Time:**

ipe = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
ga      | in general (infinitive)
ia      | present (now)
ve      | sometime in the future
ro      | sometime in the past
ne      | never 

**time based greetings**

Using verb: veda = to see

veda ga  = see you around
veda ia  = see you soon
veda ve  = see you sometime
veda ne  = I will never see you again

**singular conjugation**

* se pala-ga = in general he play
* se pala-ia = he is playing right now
* se pala-ve = he will play in the future 
* se pala-ro = he play some time ago
* se pala-ne = it never play

**plural conjugation**
* mes pala-ga = we play 
* tes pala-ga = you play
* ses pala-ga la = they play over there

**Notes:** 

* So far I have inspired from Spanish a little.
* Having fix verbs make the learning effort smaller.

## Transform a verb in attribute using "y"

paly = playful

**So far:**
* me sera paly = I'm playful
* te sera paly = you are playful 
* se sera paly = he, it or she is playful

## Locations

* Locations are so important in Maj.
* Common locations are terminated in "u".

loc = location
