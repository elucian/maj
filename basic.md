## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural for the subject.
     
singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

**example**

ita bana divu-ga maleo


## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular      | plural
--------------|-----------------------------
mi  = myself  | ne = we
ti  = you     | ve = you all
hi  = he/she  | ze = they

**Possessive**

haru = to have

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
mia = mine  | nue = ours
tia = yours | vue = yours
hia = his   | zue = theirs

**Notes:**

* pronouns are always using lowercase characters,
* pronoun can replacing the article role therefore is terminated with ,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"
* nue, vue, zue is pronounced "nwe, vwem zwe" but in Maj there is no "w"

**Time:**

Information for time is ending with "u".

tepa = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,

* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

**nouns:**

* futa  = future
* resa  = present  
* pasa  = past

**examples:**

* nara de futa = a story from future
* dice de pasa = stories from past

**sufix:**

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
re      | present (now)
fu      | sometime in the future
pa      | sometime in the past


**time based greetings**

* vidu  = to see
* alga  = sometime
* nuca  = never
* suva  = often (French souvent)
* moca  = soon  (Latin mox)

* ti vidu-fu suva ita mi. = you will see me often
* ti vidu-re alga ita mi. = you can see me sometime
* mi vidu-pa nuca ita ti. = I have never seen you before

Structure of above propositions: Subject + verb + adverb + article + pronoun.

**notes:**

* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural,
* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that is no longer used.

**singular conjugation**

* hi pala-re = he is playing right now
* hi pala-fu = he will play in the future 
* hi pala-pa = he play some time ago

**plural conjugation**
* ne pala alga = we play sometimes
* ve pala nuca = you never play
* ze pala suva = they play often

**Notes:** 

* So far I have inspired from Spanish a little.
* Having fix verbs make the learning experience better.

palu-sy = playful

**So far:**
* ma sera pala-sy = I'm playful
* ta sera pala-sy = you are playful 
* ha sera pala-sy = he, it or she is playful
