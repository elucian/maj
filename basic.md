## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural.
     
singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

**Pronoun**

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular      | plural
--------------|-----------------------------
mi  = myself  | ne = we
ti  = you     | ve = you all
hi  = he/she  | ze = they

**Possessive**

haru = to have

singular    | plural
------------|--------------------------------
mia = mine  | nue = ours
tia = yours | vue = yours

**Notes:**

* pronoun can replacing the article role,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"

**Time:**

Information for time is ending with "u".

tepa = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

ga      | sometimes soon
ra      | present (now)
fa      | sometime in the future
pa      | sometime in the past
na      | never 

**time based greetings**

Using verb: veda = to see

* ti vedu-ga  = see you soon
* ti vedu-ra  = I can see see you
* ti vedu-fa  = see you sometime
* ti vedu-pa  = I have seen you a while ago
* ti vedu-na  = I will never see you again

**singular conjugation**

**plural conjugation**
* ne pala-ga = we all play sometimes
* ve pala-ga = you all play sometimes
* ze pala-ga = they all play sometimes 

**Notes:** 

* So far I have inspired from Spanish a little.
* Having fix verbs make the learning experience better.

## Transform a verb in attribute using "sy"

palu-sy = playful

**So far:**
* ma sera pala-sy = I'm playful
* ta sera pala-sy = you are playful 
* ha sera pala-sy = he, it or she is playful
