# Basic Grammar

In this document we describe the basics of MAJ semantic.

## Greetings

You can give greetings to one person or to everyone:


Maj   | English  | Spanish    | French     | Latin     | Romanian    | Italian
------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------
ciao  |hello     | hola       | bienvenue  | salve     | salut       | ciao
salu  |health    | salud      | la santé   | salutem   | sănătate    | salute
adio  |farewell  | adiós      | à bientôt  | adios     | adio        | addio
vale  |goodbye   | dejar      | adieu      | bene      | ramas bun   | ci vediamo

**note:** Some form of salute have multiple meanings

* salo = healthy    (adjective: referring to a person or animal)
* salu = bless you  (verb: when somebody is sneezing
* lume = world      (from latin: mundo)
* luna = moon       (just in case you may be confused)

**examples:**

* ciao lume = hello world
* salo todo = health to everyone

## Words

A word can have a specialized role in a sentence. 

* Nouns are finalized with {"a","e"} or any consonant;
* Verbs are finalized with "u" and suffix, "ro", "fu", "pa";
* Adjectives are finalized with "o", "y", or any consonant;
* Adverbs like adjectives are finalized with vowel "o", "y" or consonant;
* Pronouns are monosyllabic, 2 or 3 letter long;
* Prepositions are monosyllabic, 2 or 3 letter long;
* Determinants are monosyllabic prepositions, 2 - 3 letter long;

**note:**
For word creation we have a strong rule that is very useful: A word in general start with a consonant or a vowel but should end with a vowel. This rule makes words easy to connect in a phrase using conjunctions, articles or direct.

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun in a phrase to refer either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. Maj pronoun is regular and have the following features:

**Pronoun features:**

* it has 3 persons
* it has 4 cases
* it has singular and plural (irregular forms)

**Pronouns cases:**

* nominative
* objective
* possessive

**Nominative**

Is the person or the thing who perform the action.

  ps |singular          | plural
-----|------------------|-----------------------------
  1  | yo = I           | nu  = we
  2  | tu = you         | vu  = y'all
  3  | hi = he, she, it | zu  = they

**Objective**

Is the person or the thing who receive the action.

 ps | singular         | plural

 2  | ti = you         | vu = y'all
 3  | hi = him/her     | zu = them 

**Accusative**

The accusative case is the grammatical case used to mark the direct object of a transitive verb. 

 ps | singular         | plural     
----|------------------|-----------------------------
 1  | mis = to me      | noy = to us   
 2  | tis = to you     | voy = to y'all

* All pronouns are ending with vowel
* There is no gender in pronouns;
* The singular form of "you" use to be "thou";
* Pronoun "y'all" is rarely used in US

* mi'sy = myself;
* ti'sy = yourself; 
* hi'sy = himself/ itself
* nu'sy = ourselves; 
* vu'sy = yourselves; 
* zu'sy = themselves; 

**Sort adverbs**

This is used as an augment for verb to create a new meaning.

hai = let's

* nu dovu boscu zu = we have to search him

## Verbs

so      | sota      | present (go now)
fu      | futa      | future
pa      | pasa      | past

**undefined time**

**composite**

foa   = times (French fois)

**using numerals**

lio  = place (French lieu)

* re'lio  = third   place
* ni'lio  = last place

## Proposition

Structure of proposition: Subject + verb'time + objective + adverb.

verb: vidu  = to see

* yo vidu'pa ti un'foa!  = I have seen you one time!
* hi vidu'pa vu ni'foa!  = He have never seen y'all!
* tu vidu'fu mi suv!     = You will see me often!
* nu podo vidu'so zu amu!= We can see them now!

## Interrogative

Primitive interrogation is created with prepositions:
 
maj     | english  | spanish | romanian
--------|----------|---------|---------
ke      | what?    | qué     | ce
ki      | who?     | quien   | cine
ku      | how?     | como    | cum
ko      | which?   | cual    | care
ka      | no?      | non     | nu?

Composite interrogations using preposition "de" and noun:

maj         | english  | spanish | 1:1 translation
------------|----------|---------|---------------
de ke tesa? | when?    | cuando  | about what time?
de ke loka? | where?   | donde   | about what location?
po ke reza? | why?     | por qué | for what reason?


**examples**

Next examples show how to use interrogative prepositions:

* ke magu'fu tu  ?  = what are you going to eat ?
* ki seru'pa ibi ?  = who was there?
* ku seru'so tu  ?  = how are you ?   
* ka magu'fu tu  ?  = you have not eaten ?

Asking about location can be explicit using que:

* de ke loka ti andu ? = where are you going?
* de ke loka ti venu ? = where are you coming from?
* de ke loka ti seru ? = where are you from?
    
You can ask about location isomg `ubi` or time isomg `cud`:

* es la loka ke tu joku? = is the place you play?
* es la tesa ke zu venu? = is the time they come?

**expressions**
  
You can use `von ubi`, or `tsu ubi` instead of `loka`.
  
* von ubi tsu ubi? = from where to where!

Possible answers:

* von hir tsu ibi! = from here to there!
* von loka ke tu picu!  = from a place you like!
* von tesa ke lo oviu!  = from a forgotten time!

verb: oveu = to forget

## Responses

The interogative question can be answered with affirmative or negative:

**familiar**

* si / asi = ye / yes
* ka / kan = no /  not

**polite**

* cero = indeed
* juso = right
* fawo = wrong

**logical**

* vero! = true, affirmative
* faso! = false, negative, 
* naso! = unknown

**scientific**
For stronger assurance answer you can specify the logical values:

* bono! = good, tasteful
* malo! = bad, repulsive

**composite**

* kan-juso = incorrect, not justified
* tum-juso = to be justified


## Noun

Noun is a word terminated with coda:

* coda "a" = generic singular
* coda "e" = plural

A noun represents person, place, object, or idea. 

**examples:**

* pana  = bread
* pane  = breads

You can learn more about nouns in a separate document:
[nouns](nouns.md)

## Article

In Maj, article is a short word you add in front of the noun.

* Articles are used to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 
* There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite article**

1. Definite article _indicative form:_

la  = the (singular)
le  = the (plural)

**example**

la pana = the bread
le pene = the breads

2. Definite article _determinant form:_

es = it is (seru) = to be

Singular   |  Plural
-----------|--------------
eso = this |  ese = these 
elo = that |  ele = those


**example:**

eso pana = this bred
ese pane = these breads

3. Descriptive article _descriptive form:_

de  = of the
des = about

**example:**

* English: the freckles on my face
* Spanish: las pecas en mi cara
* Maj: le pece de mia cara

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj: indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* oru = any
* omi = every
* ali = all
* mot = many
* pau = few
* van = several
* som = some 
* yxo = approximative

Common noun is using plural "e" or singular "a" with different articles:

* una mela = one apple
* dua mele = two apples
* omi mela = every apple
* oru mela = any apple
* som mele = some apples
* ali mele = all apples
* mot mele = many apples
* yxo diz male = approximative 10 apples

Invariant noun is terminated in "s" or other consonant:

* pau Mercedes = few Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 

## Determinant prefix

Sometimes we use a preposition determinant as prefix to create a new meaning for words:

* kan  = not  - create antonyms
* tum  = for  - specify purpose
* ati  = anti - against / opposite 

**examples:**

* tum-bebo aqua = drinking water
* kan-bebo aqua = industrial water
* kan-bojo beba = non alcoholic drink
* ati-gera mova = anti war move


## Special coda

Some nouns are terminated with "osa" or "ola" vowel to indicate harmful content:

**normal** 

* la ceca = the chocolate
* la huga = the juice  

**harmful**

* la ceosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* la ceola  = the chocolate drops with alcohol
* la ugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* la ugola  = juice mixed with alcohol 

## Logic conjunction

Conjunctive preposition is a word used to connect ideas and arguments in a sentence.

Conjunction is used when...

* you have two ideas and you want to connect them in a sentence;
* an idea you have, depends on another idea;
* you want to add a new idea into an existing one;

## Coding

Maj text can be executed using a Maj hosting service;

**Symbols**

{ + - / ? ! . : = * ; # ` _ ~ [ ] ( )}

1. One star `* ` follow by one space at the beginning of line start a bullet list;
1. Number `1. `  follow by dot that at beginning of line start a numbered list;
1. Use `;` to separate propositions and lists;
1. Text enclosed with `**` becomes **bold** and represents comment;
1. Any text that start with `_` becomes _italic_;
1. Any text that start with `~` becomes ~strike~;
1. Notation `[Text](URL)` is used to create hyper-links;
1. Symbol `#` is header, `##` sub-header (enlarged font);
1. Commented text HTML notation: <!-- .... --> is supported;
1. Enumerations are separated by comma, and enclose in brackets `{a,b,c}`;
1. Use triple back-quotes for inclusion of any foreign language text; 
1. Use `$` to declare variable in code or in form;
1. Use `@` to declare vector column or row;
1. Use `&` to concatenate variables in expressions;

**variables**

You can create a variable anywhere in the Maj text

@PI   = 3.14 ** constant

```
$var1 = 24, $var2 = 35  ** two variables
$var2 = {1,2,3} ** a set of variables
$var3 = [1,1,1] ** a list of variables
```

**expressions**

Use round parentheses for expressions like in following example:

This expression "var1 + PI" has value ($var1 + @PI);

**code block**

You can create code in Maj using notation `maj:`

maj: _code-name_

Use 3 back-quotes \`\`\` to create a block of code:

```
** This is a block of code
```

**Read more:** [code](code.md)

**markup**

Maj enable markup code. That can be HTML, or XML

<html>
  <h1>Static HTML </h1>  
  <p> Maj interpreter will not touch the HTML code, 
      so it can be used only for static content. </p>
  <p> For dynamic content you can use only expressions </p>    
</html>

## Input form

To create an input form you can use keyword obio: = to get

obio: $var1

 Label        | Values      
--------------|--------------------------------
"$var1"       | $var1 = 0    
"$var2"       | $var2 = 0    
TOTAL         | $var1 + $var2

* first input  = ($var1)
* second input = ($var2)

**notes**

* You can specify initial value using "=";
* You can use functions or expressions to output text;
 
## Matrix form

You can create a dynamic form using multiple rows:

obio: @values(10,5)

 "@values()"  | Values      
--------------|--------------------------------
 ...          | @values
 TOTAL        | +@values

* "@values(1,1) =" @values( 1, 1)
* "@values(2,1) =" @values( 2, 1)


**notes**

* You can specify index number using `...`
* You can specify multiple values using @values
* Using 20 you specify 20 active rows for @values
* Using /5 you can create a form with 5 active rows and scroll bar


Great!
