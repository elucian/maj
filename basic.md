**symbols**

When used in text some symbols are read out loud:

* symbol `+` is read et
* symbol `/` is read or
* symbol `:` is read cu (used for pair-up or time)

**Interrogative:**

Interrogation is created with { ci, ce, co } from Italian: {chi, che, como}
 
maj   | english  | spanish | romanian
------|----------|---------|---------
qi?   | who?     | que     | cine
qe?   | what?    | qué     | ce
qo?   | how?     | como    | cumi
ud?   | where?   | donde   | unde
      
* qi seru?  = who is ?
* qe mocu?  = what are you eating ?
* qo bebu?  = how is your drink ?
* ud seru?  = where are you?

## Articles

The article do not alter a word, just underline the value of the word in sentences. It puts the word on the spot so we know exactly what are you talking about. It is improving the semantic of propositions. But in Maj it has also a role to specify the singular or plural for the subject.
     
singular    | plural
------------|-------------
yta = this  | yte = these
ysa = that  | yse = those

## Pronoun

Is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse. 

singular    | plural
------------|-----------------------------
yo = I      | ne  = we
tu = you    | ve  = you*
zy = he/she | ze  = they
yt = it     | yte = these, yse = those

* English has translation only for plural: tu, ve = you
* The "ete" and "ese" are actually determinant articles.

**Possessive**

haru = to have
ha   = short form of haru.

singular        | plural
----------------|--------------------------------
mya = mine      | nos = ours
tya = yours     | vos = yours
zea = his/hers  | zos = theirs

**Notes:**

* pronouns are always using lowercase characters,
* pronoun can replacing the article role therefore is terminated with ,
* pronoun will indicate plural if used with "s"
* nue, vue, zue is pronounced "nwe, vwem zwe" but in Maj there is no "w"

**Time:**

Information for time is ending with "u".

tepa = time

* Verbs can be followed by time but the verb remain unchanged,
* Composite words are using "-" to link two words close together,
* Linked words are pronounced almost as a single word

**nouns:**

* futa  = future
* resa  = present  
* pasa  = past

**examples:**

* nara de futa = a story from future
* dica de pasa = talk about the past

**sufix:**

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
re      | present (now)
fu      | sometime in the future
pa      | sometime in the past


**time based greetings**

* vidu  = to see
* algo  = sometime
* nuco  = never
* suvo  = often (French souvent)
* moxo  = soon  (Latin mox)

* tu vidu'fu suvo ita mi. = you will see me often
* tu vidu're algo ita mi. = you can see me sometime
* yo vidu'pa nuco ita ti. = I have never seen you before

Structure of above propositions: Subject + verb + adverb + article + pronoun.

**notes:**

* In some Eglish dialects y'all is a thing, but you is already plural,
* Pronoun "you" is the plural form of previous "Thou", that is no longer used.

**singular conjugation**

* zy jocu're = he is playing right now
* zy jocu'fu = he will play in the future 
* zy jocu'pa = he play some time ago

**plural conjugation**
* ne jocu algo = we play sometimes
* ve jocu nuco = you never play
* ze jocu suvo = they play often

## Verb transformation

You can transform a verb into an attribute using suffix 'sha or 'she.

* xa for singular
* xe for plural

**to adjective:**

jocu => jocu'sha = playful
jocu => jocu'she = playful


**So far:**
* yo seru joca'sha = I'm playful
* tu seru joca'sha = you are playful 
* zy seru joca'sha = he is playful

**to noun:**

Use termination "ora" for singular, "ore" for plural.

* yo seru'pa una juca'ora = I was a player
* ne seru'fu juca'ore     = we will be players

## Locations

* Locations are so important in Maj.
* Common locations are nouns so they are terminated in "a".

loca = location (noun)

-----|-----------|-----------------
nora | north     | norte
sura | south     | sur
esta | est       | este
veta | west      | oeste
