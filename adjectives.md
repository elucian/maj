# Adjectives

Adjectives are words that specify properties of an object, person or process. In Maj the border between adjective, noun and verb is very easy to distibguish by last letter in each word. Maj adjectives will terminate with "o".

**note:**
Theoretical any noun can be converted into an adjective by replacing last "a" with "o". This simple transformation makes Maj more logical and easy to grock. However this rule some times can produce words that are not translated in our dictionary. 

## Fundamental adjectives

These are some examples of core adjectives in Maj:

* vero = true, vera = the truth 
* faso = true, fasa = the lie
* bono = good, bona = goodnes
* malo = bad,  mala = malice

## Word order

Most easy to create description of an object is by using the auxiliary verb "sonu".

sonu = to be 

The order of words in phrase or expresion is usually NVA = Noun Verb Adjective.

* la roze sonu rujo = the roses are red
* la fore soun belo = the flowers are beautiful

Sometimes the verb "sonu" is missing and the order NA represent a single object with one of its properties:

* la rose rujo sonu belo = the red roses are beautiful
* la djie solo sonu la meho = the sunny days are the best

The English language is usually using order AN (adjective first then the noun). This is also supported by Maj but in this case the meaning of the word can represent a new concept or idea. That is the two words become a composite new word.

## Transformation

Someone or something can acquire a new quality, this is expressed with an auxiliary verb:

bovu = become

* tu bovu'be bono = you have become good
* tu bovu'ga sano = you are becoming healty
* tu bovu'do meho = you will become better

## Composite words

An ajective can fuze together with a noun using pattern: adjective-noun and make a composite word:

* la dopo-djia = tomorrow
* la novo-djia = today
* la paso-djia = yesterday
* la paso-moga = yesterday morning
* la novo-sara = tonaight
* la novo-moga = this morning
* la raio-sola = sunshine

**micro dictionary:**

* djia = day
* noqa = night
* sara = evening
* moga = morning
* raio = radiation
* sola = the Sun

**exemples:**

* en la novo-moga la raio-sola sonu'be luqo ka ni'xai = this morning the sunshine was brighter than ever
* la mogo-veza sonu'be una feta po la mi okia = the morning view was a party for my eyes
