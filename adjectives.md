# Adjectives

Adjectives are words that specify properties of an object, person or process. Maj adjectives will terminate with "o".

## Fundamental adjectives

These are some examples of core adjectives in Maj:

* vero = true 
* faso = true
* bono = good
* malo = bad

## Transformation

Someone or something can acquire a new quality, this is expressed with an auxiliary verb:

bovu = become

* tu bovu bono = you become good
* tu bovu sano = you become healty
* tu bovu meho = you become better

## Order

The order of words in phrase or expresion is usually OVA = Object Verb Adjective.

* la roze sonu rujo = the roses are red
* la fore soun belo = the flowers are beautiful

Sometimes the verb "sonu" is missing and the order NA represent a single object with one of its properties:

* la rose rujo sonu belo = the red roses are beautiful
* la djie solo sonu la meho = the sunny days are the best

The English language is usually using order AN (adjective first then the noun). This is also supported by Maj but in this case the meaning of the word can be sometimes changed. The two words become one and the meaning of the new word can be something new.

## Composite words

Long words are formed using an adjective in front of noun using pattern: adjective-noun

djia = day

* la dopo-djia = tomorrow
* la novo-djia = today
* la paso-djia = yesterday
