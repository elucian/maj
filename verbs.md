# Verbs & conjugation


1. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. The verb can be used in conjunction with a nominative subject and an objective subject. If the subject is not near verb, it can be replaced by a pronoun.

2. The verb do not change its root with the case, person or number. Maj verbs are regular and invariable. However the same root can be used as noun, adverb or adjective by changing its coda.  

## Infinitive

In Maj the Infinitive form of verbs is terminated with coda "u". It can be used in this form or it can be used with a time suffix: {'do, 'na, 'be}.

## Time suffix

* Suffix is using apostrophe before suffix to link with the root;
* Composite words are pronounced legato as a single word;

Related noun: tesa = time

 Suffix  | From Adjective     
---------|-------------------
 do      | dopo = after  
 na      | navo = now    
 be      | befo = before 
 

**verb conjugation:**

In Maj, the verb conjuration include only time information: 

* jo joku'do = I will play
* tu joku'na = you are playing
* su joku'be = he is playing


## Imperative form

For imperative case, you you must use an auxiliary verb:

* saga = story
* dovu = must/mandatory
* diku = to talk/discuss 

**examples:**

* jo vobu'na una saga da la befa! = I will tell a story about the past!
* nu dovu sh diku'do  da la befa! = we must talk after about the past!
* tu kotu'do vobu da la nava! = you will continue to speak about the present!

## Verb transformation

Verb can be used as noun by changing coda from "u" to "o'ra".

joku => joko'ra

* tu seru'pa la joko'ra de zu  = you have been his game player;
* jo ka seru la tu joko'ra     = I'm not your game player;

Verb can be used as noun if coda "u" is replaced by "a".

* la joka se joku'pa = the game was played;
* la joka se finu'ia = the game is over now;

**ro = ul**

Use coda "e" and suffix "e'ro" to make an adjective.

joku => joke'ro = playful

* jo seru joke'ro = I'm playful
* tu seru joke'ro = you are playful 
* zu seru joke'ro = he is playful
