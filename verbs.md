# Verbs & conjugation

Maj verbs are short words representing actions or interactions.  

## Infinitive

In Maj the Infinitive form of verbs is terminated with coda "u". 

**examples:**

* jo leru = I read
* tu moku = you eat
* su xaku = he study

## Time conjugation

In Maj verb conjugation is done by adding a suffix after the coda "u".

Noun: tepa = time

 Suffix  | Meaning
---------|-------------
 va      | in the future
 ra      | in the past
  
**example:1**

Simple time conjugation:

* tu leru'va = you will read
* su moku'ra = he has eaten

**example:2**

Using preposition: bo = about

* jo diku'ra una saga bo la pasa! = I have told a story about the past!
* tu diku'va una saga bo la zuka! = you will tell now a story about the future!

## Nominative

In this case the verb represent an action done by the subject or done to the subject by somebody else.

* umo djia hume haru?   = how many days hymans have?
* umo lo daru el Dios!  = how many God gives!

**present**

In these examples the time of action is implicit: present (now).

* jo xosu en la luva;    = I'm singing in the rain.
* jo vhzu su en la luva; = I see him in the rain.

**specify time**

In next examples the time of action is specific: future or past.

* su xatu'ra en la luva;     = he was sing in the rain.
* jo xatu'va si pa luva;     = I will sing if is not raining.

## Reflexive case

In this case the subject is doing something for himself. 

**examples:**

* jo mh lavu = I'm washing myself
* tu te miru = you are looking at yourself
* su se joku = he is playing

## Interrogative

To ask someone if is doing something you can use "ke" interrogative preposition.

* ke faru tu?  = what are you doing?
* tu lo leru?  = are you reading?

**infinitive response**

For infinitive response "ia" and "pa" can be used as verb suffix.

* jo leru'ia = I read indeed
* jo leru'pa = I do not read

**specify time**

The affirmative and negative can be created with prepositions "si" and "pa". By using the preposition you can specify the time so the information is complete.


**affirmative**

* ia jo leru     = yes I'm reading
* ia jo leru'va  = yes I will read
* si jo leru'ra  = yes I was reading

**negative**

* jo pa leru    = I'm not reading
* jo pa leru'va = I will not read 
* jo pa leru're = I have not read

## Conditional

An action that is not realized is created using auxiliary verb: "voru"

* jo voru'ra sh leru da su mh lexu'pa = I wanted to read but he didn't let me
* tu voru'ra sh leru da ra tobu doma  = You wanted to read but have fall asleep

## Imperative

Maj has two imperative forms: direct and polite

* dovu = must
* saga = story
* diku = to tell/to talk

Imperative direct: is created using pronoun as prefix.

* diku'mi la saga de tu vita; = tell me your life story! 
* sagu'mi tu vita = describe your life!

Imperative polite: using auxiliary preposition "hai":

* hai tu dovu sh kotu! = Please you have to continue!
* nu dovu'ra sh leru!  = We should have read!

## Reflexive form

When you refer to some action performed by somebody on himself.

**direct reflexive:**

* jo mh joku = I'm playing
* tu te joku = you are playing
* zu se joku = he is playing

**imperative reflexive:**

Next prepositions are used in imperative sentences:

Auxiliar: hai  = let's  (leading/encouragement)

**using pronoun after verb:**

* hai sh hodu'ne  = let's rest ourselves
* hai sh kamu'ne  = let's calm ourselves

**imperative polite:**

Auxiliar verb: favu = asking for a favor

* te fevu kamu'te  => please calm yourself 
* te fevu hodu'te  => please rest yourself 
* te fevu domu'te  => please go to sleep

Auxiliar verb: dovu = must

* nu dovu sh hodu'ne = we have to rest ourselves
* vu dovu sh kamu'vh = you have to calm yourselves
* zu dovu sh domu'zh = they must sleep themselves

## Subjunctive mod

Maj verbs can use determinant particle "sh" to create subjunctive mode.

**example 1:**

* jo povu sh fabu pana = I can make bred
* su povu sh domu paqo = he can sleep peacefully

**example 2:**

* vh favu mi daru la vora? = please give me the order
* jo voru la hola ku keso! = I want the omelet with cheese
* la vora se daru'be = the order was given

## Verb transformation

Verb can be used as noun by changing coda from "u" to {"a", "o"}.

* joku = play 
* joka = game 
* joko = playful

In next example "sonu" can change the meaning of word "jok":

* tu sonu'ra la joka de zu = He trick you;
* su te xamu'ra            = I has tricked you; 
* jo sonu'pa la tu joka    = I'm not your play;
* su sonu joko             = he is playful;

## O/U inversion

In next example we use "luf" root:

* lufa = influence
* lufo = influenced
* lofu = to influence (inversion)

**example 1:**

* jo lofu'ra zu   = I have influenced him
* tu sonu'ra lofu = You had been influenced

For next example example we use verb root "pag":

* pagu = pay
* pago = payed

**example 2:**

* tu raku'ra mi vuza   = you have broken my camera
* tu hodu una dota     = you are holding a dept
* poi tu dovu sh pagu  = then you have to pay
* tu pagu la gema      = you pay the money
* la dota sonu'ra pago = the debt was payed
