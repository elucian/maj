# Verbs & conjugation

Maj verbs are short words representing actions or interactions.  

## Infinitive

In Maj the Infinitive form of verbs is terminated with coda "u". 

**examples:**

* jo leru = I read
* tu moku = you eat
* su xaku = he study

## Time conjugation

In Maj verb conjugation is done by adding a suffix after the coda "u".

 Suffix  | Meaning
---------|------------------
 na      | now
 do      | after
 va      | will
 be      | before
 ra      | would
 ia      | affirmative
 pa      | negative 

**infinitive present:**

In the next example the time of action is not specified:

* jo leru = I read
* tu joku = You play
* su moku = He eats/ Shee eats

**time prefixes:** {_na_, _va_, _be_}

In next examples the time of action is specific: present, future or past.

* su leru'na = He is reading;
* tu leru'va = You will read;
* jo leru'be = I have read;

**time adverb:**

Time suffix can be used as adjective, sligtly changing the meaning of sentance.

* su na leru = He reads now;
* su va leru = he will read;
* jo be leru = I was reading;

**using "do" and "va"

In Maj "do" represets a relarive future while "va" is an absolute future.

* su leru'va = he will read; 
* su leru'do = he read next;

It is possible and more correct to use both prefixes in the same sentance;

* su va leru'do = he will read next;
* do su leru'va = next he will read;

**conditional prefix:** {_ra_}

Adjective and suffix "ra" can express an action that was not realized for a specific reason. 

* su be xatu'ra si lo luva'pa;  = he would have sung if it would not have rain.
* su va xatu'pa si va luva;     = he will not sing if it will rain.

## Reflexive case

In this case the subject is doing something for himself. 

**examples:**

* jo mh lavu sifo = I'm washing myself
* su se joku sifo = he is playing alone
* tu te gezu ot pejo = you are looking at your mirror immage

## Interrogative

To ask someone if is doing something you can use "ke" interrogative preposition.

* ke faru tu?  = what are you doing?
* tu lo leru?  = are you reading?

**infinitive response:**

For infinitive response "ia" and "pa" can be used as verb suffix.

* jo leru'ia = I read indeed;
* jo leru'pa = I do not read;

**include time in response:**

The affirmative and negative can be created with prepositions "ia" and "pa".

**affirmative:** {_ia_}

* ia jo leru'na  = yes I'm reading;
* ia jo leru'va  = yes I will read; 
* ia jo leru'be  = yes I have read;

**negative:** {_pa_}

* jo pa leru'na = I'm not reading
* jo pa leru'va = I will not read 
* jo pa leru'be = I have not read

## Conditional

An action that is not realized is created using auxiliary verb: "voru" and prefix "ra"

* jo voru'ra sh leru da su mh lexu'pa = I wanted to read but he didn't let me;
* tu voru'ra sh leru da tobu'be domo  = You wanted to read but have fallen asleep;

## Imperative

Maj has two imperative forms: direct and polite

**dictionary:**

In next examples I will use 2 new verbs and one noun:

* dovu = must
* diku = to tell
* saga = story

**Imperative direct:** is created using the pronoun as a suffix:

* diku'mi la saga de tu vita; = tell me your life story! 
* sagu'mi tu vita = describe your life!

**Imperative polite:** using auxiliary preposition "hai":

* hai tu dovu sh diku la saga!  = Come on you have to tell the story!
* hai nu dovu sh leru la saga!  = Come on we must read the story!

## Reflexive form

When you refer to some action performed by somebody on himself you use reflexive.

**direct reflexive:**

* jo mh joku = I'm playing
* tu te joku = you are playing
* zu se joku = he is playing

**imperative reflexive:**

Next prepositions are used in imperative sentences:

Auxiliar: hai  = let's  (leading/encouragement)

**using pronoun after verb:**

* hai sh hodu'ne  = let's rest ourselves
* hai sh kamu'ne  = let's calm ourselves

**imperative polite:**

Auxiliar verb: favu = asking for a favor

* te fevu kamu'te  => please calm yourself 
* te fevu hodu'te  => please rest yourself 
* te fevu domu'te  => please go to sleep

Auxiliar verb: dovu = must

* nu dovu sh hodu'ne = we have to rest ourselves
* vu dovu sh kamu'vh = you have to calm yourselves
* zu dovu sh domu'zh = they must sleep themselves

## Subjunctive mod

Maj verbs can use determinant particle "sh" to create subjunctive mode.

**example 1:**

* jo povu sh fabu pana; = I can make bred.
* su povu sh domu paqo; = he can sleep peacefully.

**example 2:**

* vh favu mi daru la vora? = Please can I have the order?
* jo voru la hola ku keso! = I want the omelet with cheese!
* la vora se daru'be; = The order was given.

## Verb transformation

Verb can be used as noun by changing coda from "u" to {"a", "o"}.

* joku = play 
* joka = game 
* joko = playful

In next example "sonu" can change the meaning of word "jok":

* tu sonu la joka de zu    = You are his game
* su te xamu'be            = He tricked you 
* jo sonu'pa la tu joka    = I'm not your play
* su sonu joko             = he is playful

## O/U inversion

In next example we use "luf" as root of 3 words:

* lufa = influence
* lufo = influenced
* lofu = to influence (root changed to "lof")

**example 1:**

* jo lofu su   = I influence him
* tu sonu lufo de su = You are influenced by him

For next example we use verb root "pag":

* paga = payment
* pagu = pay
* pago = payed

**example 2:**

* tu raku mi foto      = you broke my camera
* tu hodu una dota     = you are holding a dept
* poi tu dovu sh pagu  = then you have to pay
* tu pagu la gema      = you pay the money
* la dota sonu'be pago = the debt was payed
