## Affirmative

The affirmative is usually build without preposition or suffix, but sometimes it is:

* ia jo leru'go = yes I'm playing
* ia su joku'go = yes he is playing

Close to afirmative is preposition "iko" = still, or verb "kotu" = to continue.

* jo ynkh leru = I still read indeed
* jo kotu sh leru = I continue to read
