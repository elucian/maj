For infinitive response "si" and "pa" can be used as verb suffix.

* jo si leru = I do read

The affirmative can be created with prepositions "si" and "pa". By using the preposition you can specify the time so the information is complete.

An action that is not realized is created using suffix "ra".

suffix: ra <= would have / should have

* nova = the present
* dopa = the future

**examples:**

Preposition: di = about

**imperative reflexive:**

Next prepositions are used in imperative sentences:

Auxiliar: hai  = let's  (leading/encouragement)

## Subjunctive mod

Maj verbs can use determinant particle "sh" to create subjunctive mode.

* vh favu mi daru la vora? = please give me the order
* jo voru la hola ku keso! = I want the omelet with cheese

## Verb transformation

Verb can be used as noun by changing coda from "u" to {"a", "o"}.

* joku = play / trick
* joka = game / fool
* joko = playful/ joking

In next example "jok" is the verb root:

* tu seru'be la joka de zu = He trick you;
* jo seru'pa la tu joka    = I'm not your fool;
* tu seru'ga joko          = you are joking;

In next example "besa" and "besu" are used:

* jo doru tu daru'mi una besa = I wish you give me a kiss
* jo doru tu sh mh besu'be = I wish you had kissed me

## O/U inversion

In next example we use root word "luf" that means influenc:

* lufa = influence
* lufo = influenced
* lofu = to influence (inversion)

**example 1:**

* jo lofu'be zu   = I have influenced him
* tu seru'be lofu = You had been influenced

Another good example of verb root is "gem" that means money.

* gema = money
* gemu = pay
* gemo = payed

**example 2:**

* tu raku'be mi vuza   = you have broken my camera
* tu hodu'ga una dota  = you are holding a dept
* poi tu dovu sh gemu  = then you have to pay
