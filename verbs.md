# Verbs & conjugation


1. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. The verb can be used in conjunction with a nominative subject and an objective subject. If the subject is not near verb, it can be replaced by a pronoun.

2. The verb do not change its root with the case, person or number. Maj verbs are regular and invariable. However the same root can be used as noun, adverb or adjective by changing its coda.  

## Infinitive

In Maj the Infinitive form of verbs is terminated with coda "u". It can be used in this form or it can be used with a time suffix: {'do, 'na, 'ra}.

## Time suffix

* Suffix is using apostrophe before suffix to link with the root;
* Composite words are pronounced legato as a single word;

Related noun: tesa = time

 Suffix  | From Adjective     
---------|-------------------
 do      | dopo = after  
 na      | navo = new    
 ra      | rama = past
 

**verb conjugation:**

In Maj, the verb conjuration include only time information: 

* jo joku'do = I will play
* tu joku'na = you are playing
* su joku'ra = he was playing


## Imperative form

## Verb transformation

joku => joku

* tu senu'ra la joka de zu   = you have been his game;
