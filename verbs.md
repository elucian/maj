## Verb examples

* doru = wish, desire

The following two messages convey the same message:

* tu boku'ga malo  = you are becoming bad
* tu boku'be soxo  = you have get dirty
* jo doru sh boku algo = I wish to become somebody

**Note:** The second example is using a metaphor: becoming dirty is equivalent to becoming bad.
