# Verbs & conjugation


1. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. The verb can be used in conjunction with a nominative subject and an objective subject. If the subject is not near verb, it can be replaced by a pronoun.

2. The verb do not change its root with the case, person or number. Maj verbs are regular and invariable. However the same root can be used as noun, adverb or adjective by changing its coda.  

## Infinitive
The infinitive form of a verb is the verb in its root form. It is the version of the verb which will appear in the dictionary. The infinitive form of a verb in English is usually preceded by: "to" (e.g., to run, to dance, to think)

In Maj the Infinitive form of verbs have a root of 3 - 5 character long and is terminated with coda "u". It can be used in this form or it can be used with time suffix.

## Time suffix

* Time is using "'" before suffix to link with the root,
* Composite words are pronounced legato as a single word.

Noun: tesa  = time

 Suffix  | Maj       | English
---------|-----------|----------------------------
 fu      | futa      | future    
 ia      | iata      | present
 pa      | pasa      | past

Verb suffix and coda must match to represent time of action.

* joku'fu = future play
* joku'ia = present play
* joku'pa = past play

## Informative proposition

Informative propositions can use verbs coda: {a,o,u} for present, past and future.

**des = of/about**

* su dicu'ia una geza des la iata = he tel a stories about the present
* su dicu'pa una geza des la futa = he have told a story about the future
* su dicu'fu una geza des la pasa = he will tel a story about the past

**Preposition:** fon = from

For informative proposition we do not need 'ya for present.

* io taru la nova fon Europa  = I bring the news from Europe
* tu taru ke nova fon Weta?   = you bring what news from West?

## Imperative coda

For imperative form of verb, you change coda from "u" to "h".

* dovu = must/mandatory
* digu = talk

**examples:**

* tu dovu sə digə'ia des la iata! = you must talk now about the present
* su dovu sə digə'ia des la pasa! = you must talk now about the past

## Verb transformation

Verb can be used as different part of proposition using a coda:"e" and suffix 'ra.

joku => joke'ra

* tu seru'pa la joke'ra de zu  = you have been his game player;
* io ka seru la tu joke'ra     = I'm not your game player;

Ver can be used as noun if coda "u" is replaced by "a"

* la joka se joku'pa = the game was played;
* la joka se finu'ia = the game is over now;

**lo = ul**

Use coda "e" and suffix 'lo to make an adjective

joku => joke'lo = playful

* io seru joke'lo = I'm playful
* tu seru joke'lo = you are playful 
* zu seru joke'lo = he is playful

## Reflexive form

**verbs:**

* kamu'te  =>  calm yourself 
* hodu'ne  =>  rest ourselves
* domu'su  =>  sleep himself

**prepositions:**

Nex prepositions are used in imperative sentences to make them friendly.

hay = let's  (leading/encouragement)
rog = please (favor)

**using pronoun after verb:**

* hay sə hodu'ne  = let's calm ourselves
* te rog kamu'te  = please calm yourself 

**using reflexive prefix**
