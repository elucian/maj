# Verbs & conjugation


1. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. The verb can be used in conjunction with a nominative subject and an objective subject. If the subject is not near verb, it can be replaced by a pronoun.

The affirmative is usually build without preposition or suffix, but sometimes it is:

* si su joku'ia = yes he is playing

Close to afirmative is preposition "iko" = still, or verb "kotu" = to continue.

* io ynkh leru = I still read indeed
* io kotu sh leru = I continue to read

In Maj any verb cab ve negated in two ways: Using preposition or suffix "pa".
