* su xaku = he study

## Time conjugation

In Maj verb conjugation is done done by adding a suffix after the coda "u".

Noun: tesa = time

 Suffix  | Meaning | Related Noun     
---------|---------|------------
 do      | after   | futa   = future
 go      | now     | nova   = present
 bo      | before  | pasa   = past

**examples:**

**infinitive**

* jo xatu en la luva    = I sing in the rain
* jo vezu su en la luva = I see him in the rain

**specify time**

* jo xatu'go en la luva    = I'm singing in the rain
* jo vezu'bo su en la luva = I have seen him in the rain

**examples:**

* jo mh lavu'go = I'm wash myself
* tu te miru'go = you are looking at yourself

## Interrogative

To ask someone if is doing something you can use "ke" interrogative preposition.

The affirmative can be created with preposition "si" that means "yes":

* jo leru jao    = then I read
* si jo leru'go  = yes I read now
* si jo iko leru = yes I still read

**negative**

In Maj any verb cab be negated in two ways: Using preposition or suffix "pa".

* jo pa leru'go = I do not read now

An action that was not realized is created using suffix "ra".

suffix: ra <= would have / should have

For imperative case, you must use an auxiliary verb:

Auxiliar: favu = please (make me a favor)

* te favu sh kamu'te  => please calm yourself

## Verb examples

In next examples we use two verbs: 

* boku = to become
* doru = wish, desire

The following two messages convey the same message:

* tu boku'go malo  = you are becoming bad
* tu boku'bo soxo  = you have get dirty
* jo doru sh boku algo = I wish to become somebody

**Note:** The second example is using a metaphor: becoming dirty is equivalent to becoming bad.

* jo doru tu daru'mi una besa = I wish you give me a kiss
