## Time conjugation

In Maj verb conjugation is done done by adding a suffix after the coda "u".

Using preposition: bo = about

* jo diku'be una saga bo la pasa! = I have told a story about the past!
* tu diku'ga una saga bo la zuka! = you will talk now about the future!
* nu diku'do una saga bo la nova! = we will talk about the present!

## Nominative

In this case the verb represent an action done by the subject or done to the subject by somebody else.

**infinitive response**

For infinitive response "si" and "pa" can be used as verb suffix.

* jo si leru = I do read
* jo pa leru = I do not read

**specify time**

The affirmative can be created with prepositions "si" and "pa". By using the preposition you can specify the time so the information is complete.


**affirmative**

* si jo leru'ga  = yes I read now
* si jo leru'do  = yes I will read
* si jo leru'be  = yes I have read

## Conditional

An action that is not realized is created using suffix "ra".

suffix: ra <= would have / should have

* jo leru'ra da su mi lexu'pa = I would have read but he didn't let me
* tu leru'ra da tu te domu'be = You would have read but you have fall asleep

## Imperative

Maj has two imperative forms: direct and polite

* dovu = must
* saga = story
* diku = to tell/to talk

Imperative direct: using pronoun prefix.

* diku'mi la saga de tu vita; = tell me your life story! 
* sagu'mi tu vita = describe your life!

Imperative polite: using auxiliary preposition:

* hai tu dovu sh sexu!    = Please you have to continue!
* nu dovu'ra sh leru'be!  = We should have read!

## Reflexive form

When you refer to some action performed by somebody on himself.

**direct reflexive:**

* jo mh joku'ga = I'm playing
* tu te joku'ga = you are playing
* zu se joku'ga = he is playing

**polite reflexive:**

Auxiliar: te favu = please make me a favor

* te favu kamu'te  => please calm yourself 
* te favu hodu'te  => please rest yourself 
* te favu domu'te  => please go to sleep

**imperative reflexive:**

Next prepositions are used in imperative sentences:

Auxiliar: hai  = let's  (leading/encouragement)

**using pronoun after verb:**

* hai sh hodu'ne  = let's rest ourselves
* hai sh kamu'ne  = let's calm ourselves

**using reflexive prefix**

Auxiliar: dovu = must

## Subjunctive mod

Maj verbs can use determinant particle "sh" to create subjunctive mode.

**example 1:**

* jo povu sh fabu pana = I can make bred
* su povu sh domu paqo = he can sleep peacefully

**example 2:**

* vh favu mi daru la vora? = please give me the order
* jo voru la hola ku keso! = I want the omelet with cheese
* la vora se daru'be = the order was given

## Verb transformation

Verb can be used as noun by changing coda from "u" to {"a", "o"}.

* joku = play / trick
* joka = game / fool
* joko = playful/ joking

In next example "jok" is the verb root:

* tu seru'be la joka de zu = He trick you;
* jo seru'pa la tu joka    = I'm not your fool;
* tu seru'ga joko          = you are joking;

In next example "besa" and "besu" are used:

* jo doru tu daru'mi una besa = I wish you give me a kiss
* jo doru tu mh besu'be = I wish you had kissed me

## O/U inversion

In next example we use "luf" root:

* lufa = influence
* lufo = influenced
* lofu = to influence (inversion)

**example 1:**

* jo lofu'be zu   = I have influenced him
* tu seru'be lofu = You had been influenced

Another good example of verb root is "pag":

* gema = money
* pagu = pay
* pago = payed

**example 2:**

* tu raku'be mi vuza   = you have broken my camera
* tu hodu'ga una dota  = you are holding a dept
* poi tu dovu sh pagu  = then you have to pay
* tu pagu la gema      = you pay the money
