# Use case

**notes:** 

* in this document I use Maj capitalization;
* sentences start with lowercase letters;
* names start with capital letters;
* informative propositions end with ;
* imperative propositions end with !
* interrogative propositions end with ?

there are some good reasons to make a new and different language:

**as a project:**

* study grammar and vocabulary of other languages;
* experiment with different words and sounds;
* making new software for string manipulations;

**as a product**

once the language is established it can be usable for:

* chat with friends;
* making fantastic movies;
* storing knowledge;
* making video games;
* artificial intelligence;

the last _use-case_ is actually the most valuable of all; we think usually in a language; it takes decades to master a language until you can use it to make rational thinking; having an efficient language will enable you to think better when making AI for computers;

# but where

Maj is designed to be very articulate and is based on a lot of air; so it can be spoken well in hot and humid places like the forest or desert; not under water where you should use a click sounds like Dolphins do; 

Maj can be used on chat. It has specifics for describing computer languages and algorithms. So I guess Maj is a descriptive "pseudo-code" and "domain specific" language for software design. 

Maj can be spoken in public but nobody will understand you. especially if you are in China, Russia or Africa, but if you are on America or Australia or Europe some words could sound familiar.

# but how

we shorten the longer words to reduce cost of pronunciation; we use mono syllabic words for most frequent words and _bi-syllabic_ or _tree-syllabic_ words for less frequent words; so Maj can be faster and more efficient than other Romanic languages; after initial calculation we estimate Maj is 50% more efficient than other languages;

in other languages, some writers are using abbreviations. in Maj all the words are already abbreviated so further abbreviation makes no sense therefore is prohibited. foreign words can be used in Maj but must be enclosed with double quotes "française" is pronounced: /fʁɑ̃.sɛz/ for example. 

**design:**

* Maj re-purpose some redundant letters: { K, Q, X, Y };
* Maj do not use cedilla letters like: Franch, Romanian or German;
* Maj is using root words and avoid composite long words;
* Maj is using simple grammar rules to reduce complexity;
* Maj has a reduced numbers of sounds easy to produce;
* Maj will have a reduced vocabulary, about 1000 words;

**rules:**

* Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root;
* Maj prefix is using dash `-` to connect with the root word;
* Maj suffix is using quote `'` to connect with the root word;
* Maj avoid synonyms and is using a single meaning for each word;
* Maj frequent words are short and less frequent words are longer;

# but why

a constructed language can have good _use-cases_.

* Maj is using an experimental notation for Latin writing;
* Maj writing can be used to write existing languages;
* Maj can be used to learn other Romanic languages;

**for Internet**

Maj is for Internet; it is for software developers from diverse countries to be able to work together in a large team even if they do not know English at all; Maj can enable communities of exceptional persons to improve themselves;

**for peace**

Maj is a language of peace; while you learn this language you also learn peace; the language is used to create ideas of serenity and purity; this will influence you in a good way making you a better person;

**for making**

Maj will enable you to make text; this reduce time to write a story or a thesis; multiply this with millions and you can change the world; so writers as well as readers will reduce time to communicate;

it is true that text do not take much space, but in the future AI will learn how to produce text; in this case, the repository knowledge will grow exponential; improving efficiency should be always a goal;

Maj is a descriptive language; a Maj interpretor can read _Maj_ and do computations to calculate values; using functions and expressions; you can describe _input/output_ forms, _data tables_, _expressions_ and _algorithms_;

it is time to stop talking and start making;
