# Motivation


History has proven that a language is a powerful possession of a nation. 

* Learning a new language is difficult,
* We spend years in schools just learning our nation language,
* Few people spend time to learn a second language,
* Even fewer know a third or more languages,

Once a language is learned there is available a new resource for you to tap into.

# History

I will not look into history of languages. This domain is close to infinity.

Conclusions:

* natural languages are evolving but slow,
* sometimes a language is pushed forward,
* constructed languages failed.

# But why

A constructed language can have good use-cases.

**As a project:**

* study grammar and vocabulary of other languages
* experiment with different algorithms
* making examples of intelligent programs

**As a product**

Once the language is finished and usable:

1.games 
2.movies
3.chat
4.teaching
5.storage
6.translation
7.thinking 

* First use case is clear. Making video games,
* For making movies with aliens that do not speak an Earth language,
* For chat with friends that do not speack English,
* For teaching other languages, science or other skills,
* For storing world knowledge and wisdom,
* For making translation between languages,
* For thinking correctly in another language that helps you to think faster.

The last use-case is actually the most valuable of all. We think usually in a language. It takes decades to master a language until you can use it to make rational thinking. Having an efficient language will enable you to think better. However this objective is difficult to achieve without a proper community and history.

# For peace

Maj is a language of peace. While you learn this language you also learn peace. The language is used to create ideas of serenity and purity. This will influence your way of spending time and make you a better person.

Reducing the time necessary to learn new thing, and storing these thing more efficient in your memory you can be much more useful to yoruself and to sociaty surrounding you. You can explain better the things to your friends or students in case you are a teacher.

# For making

Maj will enable you to make text faster. This reduce time to write a story or a thesis. Multiply this with milions and you will change the world. So writers as well as readers will reduce time to communicate.

Storage is expensive. It is true that text do not take so much space, but maybe in the future AI will learn how to produce text content. In this case, the repository knowledge will grow exponential. Improving efficiency should be always a goal.

It is time to stop talking and start making.

vale!
