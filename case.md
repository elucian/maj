# Use case

**facts:**

* Erosion of linguistic diversity has reduced the number of spoken languages to around 6,500;
* Existing spoken languages become more complex as time pass and therefore difficult to learn;
* Existing spoken languages are difficult to optimize due to government intervention;
* Existing languages are thought in schools to be used not to be improved;

For learning English you need about 5 years, from 1'st grade to 5'th grade you will learn about 1400 words. The rest of your life you learn the English. Even if you are born in US or England you will not know every words of English until you die.

**about Maj:** 

* Maj is an open source, Romance language;
* Maj is using Latin alphabet similar to English alphabet;
* Maj in contrast to English is a deterministic language;
* Maj is limited in scope and you can learn it all in one year;

**punctuation:**

in this document I use Maj pnctuation style:

* sentences start with lowercase letters;
* names start with capital letters;
* informative propositions end with ;
* imperative propositions end with !
* interrogative propositions end with ?
* enumerations start with star (*)

there are some good reasons to make a new and different language:

**as a project:**

* study grammar and vocabulary of other languages;
* experiment with different words and sounds;
* making demo software for string manipulations;

**as a product:**

once the language is established it can be usable for:

* friendly chat;
* making comments;
* outdoor activity;
* taking notes;
* video games;
* artificial intelligence;
* knowledge repository;

the last _use-case_ is actually the most valuable of all;

# but where

Maj is articulated and laud; it can be spoken in the forest, mountains or in the desert; not good under water where you should use clicking sounds like Dolphins do; Maj do not use clicking sounds;

Maj can be used on chat; it has specifics for describing computer languages and algorithms. therefore Maj is a descriptive _pseudo-code_ and _domain specific_ language; 

Maj can be spoken in public but nobody will understand you; especially if you are in China, Russia or Africa, but if you are on America or Australia or Europe some words could sound familiar.

# but how

we shorten the words to reduce cost of pronunciation; so Maj can be faster and more efficient than other Romance languages; after initial calculation we estimate Maj is 30% more efficient than other languages;

in other languages, some writers are using abbreviations. in Maj all the words are already abbreviated; therefore further abbreviation makes no sense. foreign words can be used in Maj but must be enclosed with double quotes FRA:"française" is pronounced: /fʁɑ̃.sɛz/ for example. 

We use two functions to compute cost of words during word design. one is considering pronunciation and another one is considering the cost of writing. We replace expensive letters with simpler letters to make the language more efficient.

**design:**

* Maj re-purpose some redundant letters: { Q, K, X, Y };
* Maj do not use cedilla letters like: Franch, Romanian or German;
* Maj is using root words and avoid composite long words;
* Maj is using simple grammar rules to reduce complexity;
* Maj has a reduced numbers of sounds, easy to produce;
* Maj will have a reduced vocabulary, about 2200 words;

**rules:**

* Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root;
* Maj is using quote `'` to connect with the root word with suffix or prefix;
* Maj avoid synonyms and is using mostly a single meaning for each word;
* Maj frequent words are shorter while less frequent words are longer;
* Maj words can differ from one to other by a single letter;

# but why

a constructed language can have good _use-cases_.

* Maj is using an experimental Script writing;
* Maj ideas can be used for some other languages;
* Maj can be used to learn other Romantic languages;
* Maj can be used to comment software source code;

**for Internet**

Maj is for Internet; it is for software developers from diverse countries to be able to work together in a larger team, even if they do not know English; Maj enable communities of exceptional persons to improve themselves;

**for Peace**

Maj is a language of peace; while you learn this language you also learn peace; the language is used to create ideas of serenity and purity; this will influence you in a good way making you a better person;

**for Making**

Maj will enable you to make new text; this reduce time to write a story or a thesis; multiply this with millions and you can change the world; so writers as well as readers will reduce time to communicate;

it is true that text do not take much space, but in the future AI will learn how to produce text; in this case, the repository knowledge will grow exponential; improving efficiency should be always a goal;

sorter words is the key for better text alignment. as you know full justified text require extra spaces between words. this is more suitable for Maj since it uses short words. The longest words will be maximum 7 characters long.

Maj is a descriptive language; a Maj interpretor can read _Maj_ and do computations to calculate values; using functions and expressions; you can describe _input/output_ forms, _data tables_, _expressions_ and _algorithms_;

it is time to stop talking and start making;
