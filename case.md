# Use case

**note:** in this document I use Maj capitalization!

there are some good reasons to make a new language that is very much different than current languages:

**as a project:**

* study grammar and vocabulary of other languages;
* experiment with different words and sounds;
* making training software for string manipulations;

**as a product**

once the language is established it can be usable for:

* making video games;
* making fantastic movies;
* chat with friends;
* storing knowledge;
* artificial intelligence;

the last use-case is actually the most valuable of all. we think usually in a language. it takes decades to master a language until you can use it to make rational thinking. having an efficient language will enable you to think better when making AI for computers.

# but where

Maj is designed to be very articulate and is based on a lot of air. So it can be spoken well in hot and humid places like the forest or desert. Not under water where you should use a click sounds like Dolphins do. 

Maj can be used on chat. It has specifics for describing computer languages and algorithms. So I guess Maj is a descriptive "pseudo-code" and "domain specific" language for software design. 

Maj can be spoken in public but nobody will understand you. especially if you are in China, Russia or Africa, but if you are on America or Australia or Europe some words could sound familiar.

# but how

We shorten the words to reduce cost of pronunciation. So Maj can be faster and efficient. 

**design:**

* Maj re-purpose some redundant letters: { K, Q, X, Y };
* Maj do not use cedilla letters: Franch, Romanian or German;
* Maj is using root words and avoid composite long words;
* Maj is using simple grammar rules to reduce complexity;
* Maj has a reduced numbers of sounds easy to produce;
* Maj will have a reduced vocabulary under 1000 root words;

**rules:**

* Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root,
* Maj avoid synonyms and is using a single meaning for each word,
* Maj frequent words are short and less frequent words are longer,

# but why

a constructed language can have good use-cases.

* Maj is an experimental language for Latin writing,
* Maj writing can be used to write existing languages,
* Maj can be used to learn other Romanic languages.

**for Internet**

Maj is for Internet. It is for software developers from diverse countries to be able to work together in a large team even if they do not know English at all. Maj can enable communities of exceptional persons to improve themselves.

**for peace**

Maj is a language of peace. While you learn this language you also learn peace. the language is used to create ideas of serenity and purity. this will influence you in a good way making you a better person.

**for making**

Maj will enable you to make text. this reduce time to write a story or a thesis. multiply this with millions and you will change the world. so writers as well as readers will reduce time to communicate.

storage is expensive. it is true that text do not take so much space, but maybe in the future AI will learn how to produce text content. in this case, the repository knowledge will grow exponential. improving efficiency should be always a goal.

Maybe we manage to make _smart text_. This is a text that ca do computations and logical reasoning. By doing this, you can describe a program then can _execute_ like a program. So a Maj text can be also a running program.

it is time to stop talking and start making.

**vale!**
