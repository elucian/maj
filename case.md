# Use case

**note:** in this document I use Maj capitalization!

we think the natural language evolution of Latin language has stopped. so we will give it a push forward. next are some good reasons to make a new language that is very much different than current constructed languages:

* you have spend a decade in schools learning English,
* a few people know a second language, maybe Spanish
* in these languages you can not do computation,
* programming languages can do computation but can not be spoken.

# but where

Maj is designed to be very articulate and is based on a lot of air. So it can be spoken well in hot and humid places like the forest or desert. Not under water where you should use a click alphabet like Dolphins do. 

Maj can be used on chat. It has specifics for describing computer languages and algorithms. So I guess Maj is a descriptive "pseudo-code" and "domain specific" language for software design. 

Maj can be spoken in public but Nobody will understand you. especially if you are in China, Russia or Africa, but if you are on America or Australia or Europe some words could look familiar to some people.

Maj is designed to be learn quickly and effortless. It is for software developers from diverse countries to be able to work together in a large team even if they do not know English at all.

# but how

We shorten the words to reduce cost of pronunciation. So Maj can be faster and efficient. 

**design:**

* Maj re-purpose some redundant letters: { K, Q, X, Y },
* Maj do not use cedilla letters: Franch, Romanian or German,
* Maj try to use root words and avoid composite long words,
* Maj try to find best word roots, short and easy to pronounce,
* Maj create strong and simple grammar rules to reduce complexity,
* Maj will have a reduced vocabulary under 1000 root words.

**rules:**

* Maj can use prefixes and suffixes to make a new word from a root word,
* Maj use invariant root words for nouns and regular verbs,
* Maj eliminate synonyms and prefer to use one single meaning for each root word,
* Maj most frequent words are shorter than less popular words,

# but why

a constructed language can have good use-cases.

**as a project:**

* study grammar and vocabulary of other languages,
* experiment with different new words,
* making examples of software for word manipulation.

**as a product**

once the language is established it can be usable for:

* for making video games,
* for making fantastic movies,
* for chat with friends,
* for storing knowledge and wisdom,
* for making computer thinking AI.

the last use-case is actually the most valuable of all. we think usually in a language. it takes decades to master a language until you can use it to make rational thinking. having an efficient language will enable you to think better when making AI for computers.

# For peace

Maj is a language of peace. While you learn this language you also learn peace. the language is used to create ideas of serenity and soul purity. this will influence you in a good way make you a better person.

# For making

Maj will enable you to make text. this reduce time to write a story or a thesis. multiply this with millions and you will change the world. so writers as well as readers will reduce time to communicate.

storage is expensive. it is true that text do not take so much space, but maybe in the future AI will learn how to produce text content. in this case, the repository knowledge will grow exponential. improving efficiency should be always a goal.

Maybe we manage to make smarter text. This is a text that ca do computations. By doing this, you can describe a program then "execute" the program line by line and even repeat a potion of text multiple times like a program do. So yur text can be also a running program.

it is time to stop talking and start making.

**vale!**
