## Article

An article is a word used to modify a noun, which is a person, place, object, or idea. Technically, an article is an adjective, which is any word that modifies a noun. Usually adjectives modify nouns through description, but articles are used instead to point out or refer to nouns. There are two different types of articles that we use in writing and conversation to point out or refer to a noun or group of nouns: definite and indefinite articles.

**Definite Article**

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those


Let's begin by looking at the definite article. This article is the word 'the,' and it refers directly to a specific noun or groups of nouns. For example:

* the freckles on my face
* the alligator in the pond
* the breakfast burrito on my plate

Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific.

**Indefinite Articles**
Indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

In Maj, this situation is resolved by using numeral "one" as article. 

* one Mercedes ...TODO
* one event    ...TODO 


**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)


**patterns** 

* ita  pana    = the bread
* ite  pana    = these breads
* ita  acua    = the water
* ita  bana    = the banana
* ite  bana    = these bananas
* ita  huga    = the juice  
  
* ite  cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* ita  hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* ite  cheola  = the chocolate with alcohol
* ita  hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol

## Verbs

The verbs have a root of 4 character long and is terminated with "u":

Rationale: Verbs are more often used than nouns, and are therefore more valuable so we reduce the number of characters from 5 to 4. There are plenty of possible combinations that do not sound so bad if we put some work into it.

**rules:**

1. Verb root is always terminated with "u" so is distinguish as an action of some sort. There are less verbs than nouns, so the termination "u" is not so bad.

2. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. In the above examples Tata and Mama are the subjects. The verb is used immediately after the subject. If the subject is not near by, it must be replaced by a pronoun before the verb otherwise the proposition may not make sense.

3. The verb do not change its root with the case or number. However, a word that have same root like a verb and is terminated in "a" or "e" it becomes a noun. If "u" is changed to "o" it becomes adjective.
