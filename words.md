## Verbs

The verbs have a root of 4 character long and is terminated with "u":

Rationale: Verbs are more often used than nouns, and are therefore more valuable so we reduce the number of characters from 5 to 4. There are plenty of possible combinations that do not sound so bad if we put some work into it.

**rules:**

1. Verb root is always terminated with "u" so is distinguish as an action of some sort. There are less verbs than nouns, so the termination "u" is not so bad.

2. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. In the above examples Tata and Mama are the subjects. The verb is used immediately after the subject. If the subject is not near by, it must be replaced by a pronoun before the verb otherwise the proposition may not make sense.

3. The verb do not change its root with the case or number. However, a word that have same root like a verb and is terminated in "a" or "e" it becomes a noun. If "u" is changed to "o" it becomes adjective.
