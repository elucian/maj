## verbs

The verbs have a root of 4 character long and is ending with time preposition:

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
ga      | sometime
ra      | present 
fa      | in the future
pa      | in the past
na      | never 

* Tata estu-ga ferio = Father is furious.
* Mama estu-na triso = Mama is never sad.

Rationale: Verbs are more often used than nouns, and are therefore more valuable so we reduce the number of characters from 5 to 4. There are planty of possible combinations that do not sound so bad if we put some work into it.

**rules:**

1. Verb root is always terminated with "u" so is distinguish as an action of some sort. There are less verbs than nouns, so the termiantion "u" is not so bad.

2. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. In the above examples Tata and Mama are the subjects. The verb is used immediately after the subject. If the subject is not near by, it must be replaced by a pronoun before the verb otherwise the proposition may not make sense.

3. The verb do not change its root with the subject number. It is invariant in this regard. Therefore Maj is not a musical language, does not rime very well. This is not a defect, it is a feature. We think that this will reduce the learning effort.

## adjectives:

Is an attribute related to a noun to modify or describe it.

1. Adjectives are terminated with "o" and are 5 character long:

## Numerals

Numerals can be used with nouns to specify how many:

* ti coma-pa bin bana = you have eat one banana

**Observe:** that last letter of noun is changing from "a" to "e" with numbers > 1.


## Preposition

A word governing, and usually preceding, a noun or pronoun and expressing a relation to another word or element in the clause, as in “the man on the platform,” “she arrived after dinner,” “what did you do it for ?”.

* Prepositions are usually single syllable words.
* Prepositiobs are invariant and have the same meaning. 

**Rationale**

Prepositions are very often used in Maj. Therefore they are the most important elements of the language. So we use Syllables of only 2 characters to create the prepositions. These are the shortest words in Maj.

**Category of prepositions**
