# Classification of words

**Close persons:**

Nouns are from 3 up to 6 letters long but usually 4.

maj  | english            | romanian
-----|--------------------|-----------------
Mama | mother             | mama
Tata | father             | tata
Lola | baby sitter        | ingrijitoare
Nana | grand mother       | bunica
Sana | grand father       | bunicu
Doda | nurse              | doctorita
Duda | doctor             | doctor

**Note:** 

1. Nouns representing leaving beings are starting with uppercase.
2. Person names are written with all capital letters.

* SANA     = Santa Claus
* CHICAGO  = The city of Chicago
* Maj      = Language Maj

## verbs

The verbs have a root of 4 characters and is ending with time preposition:

Maj     | English
--------|--------------------------------
ga      | sometime
ra      | present 
fa      | in the future
pa      | in the past
na      | never 

* Tata esta-ga ferio = Father is furious.
* Mama esta-na triso = Mama is never sad.

**notes:**

1. There is a problem. If a verb is ending with "ga", "ra", "fa", "pa", "na" it may be confusing to duplicate the termination. So we avoid to make verbs terminated with these groups!

2. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. In the above examples Tata and Mama are the subjects. The verb is used immediately after the subject. If the subject is not near by, it must be replaced by a pronoun before the verb otherwise the proposition may not make sense.

3. The verb do not change its root with the subject number. It is invariant in this regard. Therefore Maj is not a musical language, does not rime very well. This is not a defect, it is a feature. We think that this will reduce the learning effort.

## adjectives:

All adjectives are terminated with "o" and are 5 character long:

maj   |romanian   |spanish   |english
------|-----------|----------|---------
ferio |fericit    |feliz     |happy
triso |trist      |triste    |sad
fomeo |foame      |hambre    |hunger
seteo |sete       |sed       |thirst
frigo |frig       |frÃ­o      |cold
caldo |cald       |caliente  |warm
canso |obosit     |cansado   |tired
boreo |plictisit  |perforado |bored
icodo |ingrijorat |preocupado|anxious
curio |curios     |curioso   |curious
miedo |speriat    |miedo     |scared
calmo |linistit   |tranquilo |quiet
icsio |excitat    |excitado  |excited
furio |furios     |furioso   |furious

Adjectives can change termination to "a" or "e" to become noun.

## Nouns

1. Nouns can be articulated or non articulated.

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those

1. Common nouns are terminated with "a" and are 4 characters long,
2. Some nouns can change termination from "a" to "e" to become plural,
3. Sometimes nouns have special termination, in this case there is no plural form:

* for beverage terminated with - ola (contains alcohol),
* for food that contains a lot of sugar we use - osa,  
* for nouns representing multiple pieces we use "e" at the end.

uve = grapes      (invariant plural)
uva = grape seed  (singular may be translated different in different languages)

**patterns** 

* ita  pana   = the bread
* ite  pane   = these breads
* ita  acua   = the water
* ita  banana = the banana
* ite  banane = these bananas
* ita  hugos  = sweet juice  
  
* ite checosa = the cookies with chocolate
* ite cheola  = the chocolate with alcohol

##: numerals

Numerals can be used with nouns to specify how many:

* ti coma-pa bin pana = you have eat one banana
* ti coma-pa cut mere = you have eat two apples

**Observe:** that last letter of noun is changing from "a" to "e" with numbers > 1.
