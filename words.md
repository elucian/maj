# Classification of words

**word role*

A word can have a specialized role in a sentence. 

* Nouns are usually finalized with {"a","u","e"} or consonant
* Adjectives are finalized with suffix "sa"
* Verbs are finalized with suffix "re", "fu", "pa", "so"
* Adverbs are usually finalized with vowel "o" or a consonant
* Prepositions are monosyllabic, and do not have coda.

There are no other parts of propositions. Any word will fall into one of these categories.

## Nouns

* Nouns are usually terminated with a vowel,
* Nouns are usually from 2 up to 3 syllables long,
* Nouns representing persons are starting with uppercase letter,
* Names are written with capital letters,

**examples:**

* CHICAGO   = The city of Chicago
* SANA      = Santa Claus
* Crimys    = Christmas 
* Maj       = Language Maj

**2 syllables**

Mama    | mother         | mama
Tata    | father         | tata
Nana    | grand mother   | bunica
Naxu    | grand father   | bunicu
Homo    | men            | bărbat

Dotora  | doctor         | doctor
Lolita  | baby sitter    | ingrijitoare
Locara  | worker         | ingrijitor


2. for distinguish between male and female beings we use adjectives: 

* maso  = male    (latin: masculum)
* fema  = female  (latin: feminam)

```
maso cyne  = dog male
fema cyne  = dog female
```

## Noun suffix

* In Maj a word have a root. To this root you can add a suffix.
* After root you can use apostrophe `'` to connect with a suffix.

Sometimes we use suffix to create a composite word for representing nouns:

**harmful content**

* for beverage containing alcohol, we use suffix 'ola 
* there is food prepared with alcohol we also use 'ola 
* for food that contains a lot of sugar we use 'osa,  

```
* ber'ola  = bear
* gas'osa  = sweet drink
* xoc'osa  = sweet chocolate
* xoc'ola  = sweet chocolate with alcohol
```

**diminutives**

Maj enable diminutives using suffix: 'uca. 

```
** close persons
Mam'uca  = mommy
Tat'uca  = daddy

** close pet
maso cyn'uca  = dogy male
femo cyn'uca  = dogy female
```

**notes**
* Whe a noun is uses suffix, it looses a vowel from last syllable that is replaced by apostrophe,
* Proper nouns (names of places or persons) do not support diminutives.

## Noun prefix

Sometimes we use a prefix to create a new word:

* no  = not - create antonyms
* po  = for - specify purpose
 

## Article

An article is a word used to modify a noun, which is a person, place, object, or idea. Technically, an article is an adjective, which is any word that modifies a noun. Usually adjectives modify nouns through description, but articles are used instead to _point out_ or _refer_ nouns or a group of nouns. 

There are two different types of articles: definite and indefinite articles.

**Maj definite Article**

singular     | plural
-------------|-------------
ica = the    | ice = the (many)
ita = this   | ite = these
isa = that   | ise = those


Let's begin by looking at the definite article. This article is the word 'the,' and it refers directly to a specific noun or groups of nouns. For example:

* the freckles on my face
* the alligator in the pond
* the breakfast burrito on my plate

Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific.

**English indefinite articles**
In English, indefinite articles are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example:

* a Mercedes from the car lot
* an event in history

In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world.

**Maj indefinite article**

In Maj, indefinite article is resolved by using _numeral articles_. 

* uno Mercedes = a Mercedes 
* oru Mercedes = any Mercedes 

Other numeral articles:

oru = any
omi = every
ale = all
mot = many
poc = few
van = several
som = some 
non = none

**Article Usage**

Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this.

If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A vowel sound is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example:

* an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel)
* an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel)


**patterns** 

* ita  pana    = the bread
* ite  pana    = these breads
* ita  acua    = the water
* ita  bana    = the banana
* ite  bana    = these bananas
* ita  huga    = the juice  
  
* ite  cheosa  = the cookies with chocolate
* ita  hugosa  = extra sweet juice 
* ite  cheola  = the chocolate with alcohol
* ita  hugola  = juice mixed with alcohol

## Verbs

The verbs have a root of 4 - 5 character long and is terminated with "u":

Rationale: Verbs are more often used than nouns, and are therefore more valuable so we reduce the number of characters from 6 to 4. There are plenty of possible combinations that do not sound so bad if we put some work into it.

**rules:**

1. Verb root is always terminated with "u" so is distinguish as an action of some sort. There are less verbs than nouns, so the termination "u" is not so bad.

2. A verb is referring to somebody or something that is the subject of the discussion. In the above examples Tata and Mama are the subjects. The verb is used immediately after the subject. If the subject is not near by, it must be replaced by a pronoun before the verb otherwise the proposition may not make sense.

3. The verb do not change its root with the case or number. However, a word that have same root like a verb and is terminated in "a" or "e" it becomes a noun. If "u" is changed to "o" it becomes adjective.

## Preposition

* Prepositions are usually single syllable words.
* Prepositiobs are invariant and have the same meaning.
