## Writing direction

To write a Maj letter you start with position 1, then you continue with 2 and do not lift your pen until you finish the letter.

## Cost of writing

The cost of writing can be calculated using 3 classes depending on letter difficulty:

Cost |  Letter
-----|----------------------------
  1  |aisxvgoune
  2  |jbcqtwym
  3  |rhlzdfpk

Const of writing can be used in an algorithm similar to cost of reading to evaluate word complexity.

## Examples of words in Maj

**example:**

1. ნʋ.ყრდʋ.ცʋ.ციშ⍺.ʋɚჺ.ცʋ.ɣჲɕ⍺;
1. nu yrdu cu cima uel cu goxa;
1. we go to cinema or to supermarket;

**notes:**

* In Maj script, words are separated by a dot instead of space. 
* It is possible to add one space after the dot, before the next letter.

**Note:** We could have invent our own letters, but we have preferred to do a compilation instead. This is an opportunity for Maj scholars to learn symbols from different alphabets. I thought this could be interesting since some of the letters should look familiar to you already. Some are Greek letters, some are Georgian letters and some are Latin letters. All these letters have something in common. They are easy to write with stylus using a single continuous movement of the pen on paper without interruptions.


And this is done. Great!
