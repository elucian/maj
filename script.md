## Maj script

Maj script is a creole alphabet with letters from Georgian, Greek and Latin. It has 28 letters in contrast to Latin alphabet who has only 26 letters. 

* Maj letters are continuous, single strike;
* Maj script is for writing with stylus on tablet;
* Maj script is mapped almost 1:1 with Lating alphabet;

## Writing direction

To write a Maj letter you start with move 1, then you continue with move 2 and do not lift your pen until you finish the letter. Some letters have loops and some have full stops with returns. The return is never 100% over like it is on some Latin letters. It is slightly off.
