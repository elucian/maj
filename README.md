## Words

Some of the Maj words are inspired from different European languages. Sometimes we revert the word to the original Latin root. Our struggle is to produce unique words and avoid duplicates. 

Maj words are short and easy to memorize. Maj has ancient roots but also modern words like "foto" or "fona" that represents technological advanced decives that do not exist in Latin. 

We mix and create short words inspired from different languages: For example word: "ha" = yes comes from Japonese word "hai". Words {pa, si, tu, mi} comes from French. Words like: {on, of, or, as} come from English. 

We create new words that have no resamblange with existing languages. For examle {na, ma, eg, ja, ob, oi}. In total we have 64 short words and prefixes using two letters.  

## Essentials

Maj has reduced complexity compared to other Romance languages: (French, English, Romanian, Italian). Maj is more like English that also uses very short words. Actually some words are shorter in English than Maj. For example verbs ENG: {do, go, be} are shorter than the respective Maj words: {faru, andu, sonu}.
