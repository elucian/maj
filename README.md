## Alphabet

Purpose of Maj alphabet is to maximize the number of sounds using ISO Latin letters and avoiding digraphs. We want to use a normal QUERTY keyboard to type Maj text. Unfortunately Latin characters are not easy to write therefore Maj has actually two alphabets: "print alphabet" that uses Latin characters and "script alphabet" that is cursive.

* Maj has a total of 28 letters in the alphabet;
* Maj has deterministic phonetic rules for reading and writing;
* There are 2 letters: {h, g} having associated 2 sounds each;

The alphabet starts with same letters "A, B, C" like any Romance languages but some letters are ordered differently due put pronunciation sounds that can be more easy to learn this way in Maj. 

 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----
 A | B | C | D | F | G | H | E | I  | J  | K  | L  | M  
 a | b | c | d | f | g | h | e | i  | j  | k  | l  | m  
 N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V  | W  | X  | Y  | Z
