**Principles:**

Basic principles for Maj construction:

1. for writing system we use ISO Latin alphabet;
1. one letter do not represent anything else but itself;
1. most letters represent a single sound (1:1);
1. two letters can be combined to create a new sound (2:1);
1. letters in words are oriented from left to right;
1. words are separated between them by at least one space;
1. words are ordered in propositions from left to right;

**Punctuation:**

1. A name of a single place or single person or pet can be written with CAPITAL LETTERS;
1. A word that represent a person, animal or insect but not a name start with uppercase;
1. A word for a thing that can do anything but exist will start with lowercase;
1. A interrogative sentences start with a specific preposition and end with a question mark;
1. A imperative sentence end with exclamation mark, while a declarative sentence with `;`
1. An enumeration of symbols or things is enclosed in squiggly brackets {a,b,c};
1. An enumeration of numbers is enclosed in square brackets [1,24,3];
1. You can use single apostrophe symbol: `'` to add a suffix and create a composite word;
1. You can use dash `-` to concatenate a prefix to a root and create a composite word;
1. You can use plus `+` to concatenate numerals and form a large numeral;
1. You can use `:`,`,` and `.` with numbers to create time, large and small numbers with decimals;
1. You can use single back-quote: `4+4` to enclose an mathematical expression or in-line code;
1. You can use round parenthesis for math expressions and complex numbers (a = b + c);
1. Text enclosed in parenthesis (expressions) or (enumerations) are silent;
1. Dialog is start with bullet point `*` and end with `;`,`?` or `!`;


**Notes:**
* Dot `.` is not used for end of propositions but is a numeric decimal separator;
* Comma `,` is used in propositions to separate multiple arguments or ideas;
* When you compare someone with an animal; the animal is written with lowercase;

## Words

**technology:**

* Maj alphabet is deterministic and precise. One distinct sound for each letter;
* All words are created manually using a translation spreadsheet;
* Words are abbreviated as much as possible not translated one to one;
* When there is divergence between root languages, Maj words can be original;
* We preserve significant syllables from origins to create a short word;
* Sometimes we add letters or coda, to improve pronunciation;
* Sometimes we cut out letters from long words to make it shorter;
* Maj numerals are original but first letter is inspired from Romanic languages;
* Most words including numerals are starting with consonant and end with vowel;
