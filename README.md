## Alphabet

Mission of Maj alphabet is to maximize the number of sounds using ISO Latin letters. We want to use a normal QUERTY keyboard to type Maj text but also to write Maj using a pen. Unfortunately print characters are not easy to write therefore Maj has actually two alphabets: print alphabet and script alphabet.

* Maj has a total of 28 letters in the alphabet;
* Maj has deterministic phonetic rules for reading and writing;
* There are 2 letters: {h, g} having associated 2 sounds each;

The alphabet starts with same letters "A, B, C" like any Romance languages but some letters are ordered differently to include the missing letters: hard G = ğ and soft G = ĝ, plust the additional letter ə = ă that is not available in ISO Latin.


a | b | c | d | e | f |ğ |ĝ |ɦ |ə |i |j |k |l 
--|---|---|---|---|---|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
m |n  |o  |p  |q  |r  |s |x |t |u |v |y |w |z 


**Phoneme:**

A phoneme is a consonant, vowel or a diphthong:

* Maj has 55 phonemes 
* English has only 44 phonemes;
* Italian has only 30 phonemes;
* Romanian has only 29 phonemes;
* French has only 39 phonemes;

**Notes:**
Since Maj has more phonemes than other Romance languages it can have shorter words. We think it does. Two additional letters are little price to pay for a big advantage. Unfortunately we have introduced letters: "ğ ĝ ɦ ə" that are not on the keyboard. To compensate we have established reading rules so that you can use normal "g" and normal "h" to compensate for the missingl letters.

**Script:**

Maj has an alternative hand writing alphabet optimized for stylus or pen.

* ƍαυ.რυიα;   = qau muna;
* ɛζα.ɛσ.რαʓ! = eta es maj!

The script alphabet is mapped with the Latin print alphabet.
